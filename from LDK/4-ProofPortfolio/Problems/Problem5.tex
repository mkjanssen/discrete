\maketitle

Chose one problem from each numbered group.  For example, choose only one of 5A, 5B, and 5C.\\

The goal here is for you to become competent in proof writing and confident in your ability in your future courses.  No collaboration and no outside resources. Please see me when you need support.\\

Remember to see the directions for what to do with conjectures that are false.  \\




%Using proof by contradiction
	
\noindent\textbf{Conjecture 5A.}\footnote{Recall that $\log_3 8$ is  a real number $a$ such that $3^a = 8$.}  The real number $\log_3 8$ is irrational.\\


\noindent\textbf{Conjecture 5B.}\footnote{You can assume $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational (we proved this in class). However, you can not assume $\sqrt{18}$ is irrational. In any case, the irrational numbers are not closed under subtraction.}  The real number $\sqrt{18} - \sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\\

\noindent\textbf{Conjecture 5C.} \footnote{You may assume the following: for any prime $p$ if $p\mid a\cdot b$ then $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$.}  For all integers $p$, if $p$ is a prime number then $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational.
