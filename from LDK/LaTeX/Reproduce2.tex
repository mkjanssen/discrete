\begin{thm}
The set $\{ x\in\Z : |x-2.5| = 2 \}$ is the empty set.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $y$ be an integer such that $y \in \{ x\in\Z : |x-2.5| = 2 \}$  Then $y\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $|y-2.5| = 2$.  Since $|y-2.5| = 2$ then $y = 4.5$ or $y=-.5$.  But then $y$ is not an integer.  Therefore the set $\{ x\in\Z : |x-2.5| = 2 \}$ has no elements and
\[\{ x\in\Z : |x-2.5| = 2 \} = \emptyset.\]
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
There exist two positive irrational numbers $s$ and $t$ such that $s^t$ is rational.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We will consider two cases.  For the first case, suppose that $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational.  Then we may take $s= t = \sqrt{2}$.  For the second case, suppose that $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational.  Let $s= \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $t=\sqrt{2}$.  Then 
$$\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \left(\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 2.$$
Since $2$ is rational, $s^t$ is rational.  Therefore, there exists irrational numbers $s$ and $t$ such that $s^t$ is rational.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
Let $n$ be a natural number.  Then $$\sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$
\end{thm}

Consider the following matrix,
$$\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 &2 &3\\
4 &5 &6\\
7 &8 &9
\end{array}\right)$$
