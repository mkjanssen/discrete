<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose Prof. Clark, fresh off the success of Pizza and a Presentation, is looking to establish two committees of people interested in helping organize future versions: a pizza-planning committee for choosing the pizzas and consisting of \(k\) members; and a speaker-planning committee for choosing speakers and consisting of \(r\) members. A total of \(n\) people have expressed interest in serving on one of the committees, and Prof. Clark decides that no one should be on both committees. How many ways are there for him to assign members to the committees?</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">On the one hand, there are \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways to construct the pizza-planning committee. Then, there are \(n-k\) volunteers remaining, so there are \(\binom{n-k}{r}\) ways to construct the speaker-planning committee and so \(\binom{n}{k} \binom{n-k}{r}\) ways of constructing both committees.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">On the other hand, perhaps we construct the speaker-planning committee first; there are \(\binom{n}{r}\) ways to do so. Then we choose the \(k\)-member pizza-planning committee from the remaining \(n-r\) interested volunteers.</p></article></body>
