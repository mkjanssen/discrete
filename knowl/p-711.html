<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose \(G\) is connected, has \(v\) vertices, and \(v-1\) edges. If \(G\) is not a tree, then it must have at least one cycle (since it's connected). If we remove one edge \(e_1\) from its cycle, then \(G_1 = G\setminus e_1\) is still connected. If \(G_1\) has a cycle, then remove \(e_2\) from the cycle to obtain \(G_2\text{,}\) which must still be connected. Continue in this way to obtain a connected graph \(G_k\) with no cycles, which must be a tree. Additionally, \(G_k\) is \(G\) with \(k\) edges removed, so it has \(v-1-k\) edges. However, since \(G_k\) has \(v\) vertices and is a tree, <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-tree-edge-vertex.html" title="Proposition 13.2.4">PropositionÂ 13.2.4</a>  must have \(v-1\) edges, which is a contradiction unless \(k=0\text{,}\) in which case \(G\) had no cycles to begin with. Thus, \(G\) is a tree.</p>
