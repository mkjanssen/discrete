      <title>A Note to Students</title>
      <p>
      This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world God has made. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

            Today's material comes from <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-statements.html">Section 0.2 of the book</url>, up through "Truth Conditions for Connectives". You're encouraged to read it before coming to class.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We'll begin with an overview of the class. Watch the screencast below and read the <url href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds">syllabus</url> for more information. Then, it's math time!
          </p>

            <idx><h>molecular statement</h></idx>
      
            Our first definition is that of a <term>statement</term>, which
            is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
            A statement is
            <term>atomic</term> if it cannot be divided into smaller statements,
            otherwise it is called
            <term>molecular</term>.

              <p>
                In groups of 2-3, determine whether the following are statements. Be sure you can explain your thinking!
                
                <ol>
                  <li>The integer 3 is odd. </li>

                  <li> There exists a real number such that <m>x^2 + 4x= 9</m>. </li>
                
                  <li> <m>x^2+4x=9</m>. </li>

                  <li> This is really difficult! </li>
                
                  <li> (Challenge) This statement is false.</li>

                 It is a well known law in the United States that you must be 16 years of age or older to drive a car without an adult present. Suppose now that four cards are placed on the table each of which has an age on one side and a vehicle on the other. The visible faces of the cards show 11, 17, a bicycle, and a car. If each card represents a person, which card(s) must you check to make sure everyone is a law abiding citizen? That is, which card(s) must you turn over to verify the proposition:

                 This exercise is practice with checking if a conditional statement is true. Consider the following conditional statement:
                 
                 <blockquote>
                   If I win the lottery, every student in this class gets an A.

                 In this conditional statement, what is the hypothesis and what is the conclusion?
                 Which of the following circumstances make the conditional statement bolded above false?

                When constructing proofs, it is sometimes helpful to prove the contrapositive of a conditional rather than the conditional itself. The downside of this approach is that we generally lose the causal chain; rather than explaining why statement <m>Q</m> follows from <m>P</m>, we show that <m>P</m> could not be true if <m>Q</m> were not. <aside>I recognize that this is pretty abstract! More details when we get to chapter 3.</aside>

                In order to make use of the work we've done on statements to do actual mathematics, we need a way of introducing variables.
                A sentence with a variable is known as a <term>predicate</term>.

              <p>
                Consider the sentence "<m>m</m> is composite". Is this true, false, or not a statement?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                What we need to do is specify a <emph>quantifier</emph> and <emph>domain of discourse</emph> for our variable. 
                In mathematics, we deal with two quantifiers: the existential quantifier and the universal quantifier.

              <p>
                Much of the time, quantifiers are relatively straightforward, even implied by a precise way of speaking.
                One exception to this is when we seek to negate a quantified statement.

      <introduction>
        <p>
            This week, we explore a few more mathematical preliminaries. We first dive into the things we can do with sets.
            Then, we move to relations and equivalence relations, foundational notions both for future work in matheamtics (even in this class).
            Our first portfolio problem is due on Wednesday; this is really an introduction to <m>\LaTeX</m>, the language in which we'll write our mathematical portfolio work.
            Also due Wednesday is an Edfinity assignment over <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html">Section 0.3</url>, and we'll take a weekly quiz over the notes on Friday.

                  <statement>
                    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
                    The <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m>, is the set containing all elements <m>x</m> which are in <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> (or both).
                    The intersection <m>A\cap B</m> is the set of all elements of <m>x</m> in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

                </p>

              <p permid="SNP">
                Often when dealing with sets,
                we will have some understanding as to what <q>everything</q> is.
                Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers.
                In this case we would say that our
                <term>universe</term> is <m>\N</m>.
                <idx><h>universe set</h></idx>
                Sometimes we denote this universe by <m>\U</m>.
                Given this context,
                we might wish to speak of all the elements which are
                <em>not</em> in a particular set.
                We say <m>B</m> is the <term>complement</term>
                    <idx><h>complement of a set</h></idx>
                of <m>A</m>, and write,
                <me permid="Czy">
                  B = \bar A
                </me>
                when <m>B</m> contains every element not contained in <m>A</m>.
                So, if our universe is <m>\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}</m>,
                and <m>A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}</m>,
                then <m>\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}</m>.
              </p>
              
              <p permid="yUY">
                Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time.
                For example, consider
                <me permid="iGH">
                  A \cap \bar B
                </me>.

              <p permid="fch">
                This is the set of all elements which are both elements of <m>A</m> and not elements of <m>B</m>.
                What have we done?
                We've started with <m>A</m> and removed all of the elements which were in <m>B</m>.
                Another way to write this is the
                <term>set difference</term>:
                    <idx><h>set</h><h>difference</h></idx>
                    <idx><h>difference of sets</h></idx>

        <introduction>
          <p>
              This week, we are all about <term>functions</term>. The notion of function is a foundational idea in all fields of mathematics and related disciplines, from calculus to abstract algebra and everywhere in between, including the discrete ideas we'll explore this semester. So, this week we get a brief overview of what functions (defined more abstractly) are, as well as some of the properties they might have. Don't forget that the first reading reflection is due on Monday (Feb 1), and we'll discuss the reading in class on Wednesday.

                <p>
                  The definition of a function we supply here is slightly different than the <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html#sKa">definition given in the book</url>, as we have the language of relations that our book does not develop.

                    <p>
                      Let <m>X,Y</m> be nonempty sets.
                      A <term>function</term> (or <term>map</term>, or <term>mapping</term>) is a relation <m>f</m> on <m>X\times Y</m> in which each element <m>x\in X</m> is related to exactly one element <m>y\in Y</m>. We write <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>f : X\to Y</m>. We say that <m>X</m> is the <term>domain</term> of <m>f</m>, <m>Y</m> is the <term>codomain</term> of <m>f</m>, <m>y</m> is the <term>image</term> of <m>x</m> under <m>f</m>, and the set <m>\ran(f) = \setof{y\in Y}{\exists x\in X, y=f(x)}</m> is the <term>range</term> of <m>f</m>.

                  Wow, that's a lot! Let's spend some time exploring this, first with an example.

                <title>Representations of Functions</title>
                
                <p>
                  <em>Definining</em> a function requires three elements: a domain, a codomain, and an assignment of each member of the domain to a unique member of the codomain.
                  As your experience suggests, there are several ways to <em>represent</em> that assignment, such as via a <q>rule</q> (e.g., those defined by algebraic expressions, though not all algebraic expressions define functions); via a graphical relationship; via a table, or in words (e.g., the birthday function).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  In this class, our domains and codomains will generally be discrete sets, such as <m>\N</m> or <m>\Z</m>, and very often they will be <em>finite sets</em>. This allows us to be more explicit about the assignments we make.
                </p>
                
                <example>
                  <statement>
                    <p>
                      Let's represent the functions described in <xref ref="example-functiondef" /> in as many ways as possible.

              Today's material comes from <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html">Section 0.4</url> of the book. You're encouraged to read it before coming to class. We'll also discuss the first five chapters of <em>Mathematics for Human Flourishing</em> following on the reading and reflection you recently completed, so please refresh your thoughts on that book as well.

                      <li>What is matheamtics? What connection do you see between doing mathematics and being human?</li>
                      <li>Think of a time you were captivated by exploring something. What analogies can you draw between doing math and doing this exploration?</li>
                      <li>How does abstraction enrich the meaning of an idea? Give an example from your own experiences.</li>
                      <li>Think of an activity you associate with play. Make a list of all the things you enjoy about its playful aspects. Does your list have analogies in mathematical activities?</li>
                      <li>What role does beauty have in the Christian life?</li>
                      <li>Where is mathematical beauty found in the world?</li>

                <title>Recursive Definitions of Functions</title>
                
                <p>
                  We've so far seen that we can define functions by listing ordered pairs, giving rules, drawing arrow diagrams, and the like. Another important method for defining functions (especially in computer science) is with a <term>recursive definition</term>.
                </p>
                
                <p permid="DSZ">
                  Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a
                  <q>real world</q> problem,
                  because they describe how the values of the functions are changing.
                  However, this comes with a price.
                  It is harder to calculate the image of a single input,
                  since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.

                  If images tell us where functions send elements and sets of the codomain, then <term>inverse images</term> (sometimes called <em>preimages</em>) describe which objects in the domain get sent to particular objects (elements, subsets) of the codomain. <aside>I differ from our book in preferring the term <q>preimage</q>; the inverse image of sets and elements in the codomain can be calculated even for functions which do not have inverses, and I find the double meaning of the word <q>inverse</q> annoying.</aside>

              This week, we investigate some counting problems with intentionality.
              We'll develop some principles for doing certain types of counting, and then see how far we can push them.

                Today we start counting. Well, you've been doing a form of counting your whole life, and we saw an initial example of the types of counting questions in which we'll be interested in <xref ref="expl-first-counting" />.
                Our counting questions will often take the form <q>How many possible <em>qrsabs</em> are there subject to the constraint <em>jkasdghjkl</em>, where the order of the <em>qrsabs</em> may/may not matter?</q> (And where these words are mostly made up).

                      <m>\{0, 1, \ldots, 9, \mathrm{A, B, C, D, E, F}\}</m>.
                      So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8.

                  (involving more than 3 sets).

                <p>
                  Here's another counting problem involving sets.
                  Given a set <m>A</m>, recall that the <em>power set of</em> <m>A</m>, denoted <m>\pow(A)</m>, is the set of all subsets of <m>A</m>.
                  Can we predict ahead of time how many subsets a set will have?
                  That is, given a set <m>A</m>, can we calculate <m>\card{\pow(A)}</m> if we know <m>\card{A}</m>?

                    In chess, a rook can move only in straight lines

                    in the upper left corner, can take to get to that square.
                    For example, one square is already filled in.
                    There are six different paths from the rook to the square: DDRR
                    (down down right right),
                    DRDR, DRRD, RDDR, RDRD and RRDD.

              This week, we continue exploring elementary counting problems through our study of binomial coefficients and the related notions of permutations and combinations.
              Near the end of the week, we may see some combinatorial proofs (to be explored in greater detail next week). Also, the <url ref="https://dordt.instructure.com/courses/3110050/assignments/30476433">second M4HF reflection</url> is due on Friday.

                  This can continue as far down as we like.
                  The recurrence relation for
                  <m>{n \choose k}</m> tells us that each entry in the triangle is the sum of the two entries above it.
                  The entries on the sides of the triangle are always 1.
                  This is because <m>{n \choose 0} = 1</m> for all <m>n</m> since there is only one way to pick 0 of <m>n</m> objects and
                  <m>{n \choose n} = 1</m> since there is one way to select all <m>n</m> out of <m>n</m> objects.
                  Using the recurrence relation,
                  and the fact that the sides of the triangle are 1's, we can easily replace all the entries above with the correct values of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
                  Doing so gives us <term>Pascal's triangle</term>.

                      Here is another way to find the number of <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements:
                      first select which <m>k</m> elements will be in the permutation,
                      then count how many ways there are to arrange them.
                      Once you have selected the <m>k</m> objects,
                      we know there are <m>k!</m> ways to arrange (permute) them.
                      But how do you select <m>k</m> objects from the <m>n</m>?
                      You have <m>n</m> objects, and you need to
                      <em>choose</em> <m>k</m> of them.
                      You can do that in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
                      Then for each choice of those <m>k</m> elements,
                      we can permute <em>them</em> in <m>k!</m> ways.
                      Using the multiplicative principle,

                      We say <m>P(n,k)</m> counts <em>permutations</em>,
                      and <m>{n \choose k}</m> counts <em>combinations</em>.
                      The formulas for each are very similar,
                      there is just an extra <m>k!</m> in the denominator of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
                      That extra <m>k!</m> accounts for the fact that
                      <m>{n \choose k}</m> does not distinguish between the different orders that the <m>k</m> objects can appear in.
                      We are just selecting
                      (or choosing)
                      the <m>k</m> objects, not arranging them.
                      Perhaps <q>combination</q> is a misleading label.
                      We don't mean it like a combination lock
                      (where the order would definitely matter).
                      Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors
                      <mdash/> you just need to decide which flavors to combine,
                      not the order in which to combine them.

                          Prof. Clark is once again getting ready to order pizzas for the next Pizza and Presentation. Recall from <xref ref="invest-pizzas" /> that there are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Three choices for crusts (thin, hand-tossed, thick)</li>
                          <li>Three choices for sauce (red, white, BBQ)</li>
                          <li>Fifteen choices for toppings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          How many different pizzas are possible if Prof. Clark can make one choice for crust, one choice for sauce, and then choose any number of toppings?
                        </p>

                      <solution>
                        <p>
                         The main problem is to figure out the number of choices for toppings.
                            We will assume no repeated toppings (or at least that, e.g., double pepperoni is the same as single pepperoni for the purposes of counting combinations of toppings).
                            We also assume that the order in which toppings are added does not matter (possibly contentious!).
                            Note that for <m>0 \le k \le 15</m>, there are <m>\binom{15}{k}</m> ways to make a <m>k</m>-topping pizza.
                            Then there are
                            <me>
                                3\cdot 3\cdot \sum\limits_{k=0}^{15} \binom{15}{k} = 294,912
                            </me>
                            
                            possible pizzas.

                  This is an example of a <term>combinatorial proof</term>, which seeks to establish an identity (that is, an equation) by asking a counting question, and answering it in two different ways. Since the two methods answer the same question, they must in fact be equal. We now explore some additional examples.

                      Suppose Prof. Clark, fresh off the success of Pizza and a Presentation, is looking to establish two committees of people interested in helping organize future versions: a pizza-planning committee for choosing the pizzas and consisting of <m>k</m> members; and a speaker-planning committee for choosing speakers and consisting of <m>r</m> members. A total of <m>n</m> people have expressed interest in serving on one of the committees, and Prof. Clark decides that no one should be on both committees. How many ways are there for him to assign members to the committees?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the one hand, there are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> ways to construct the pizza-planning committee. Then, there are <m>n-k</m> volunteers remaining, so there are <m>\binom{n-k}{r}</m> ways to construct the speaker-planning committee and so <m>\binom{n}{k} \binom{n-k}{r}</m> ways of constructing both committees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the other hand, perhaps we construct the speaker-planning committee first; there are <m>\binom{n}{r}</m> ways to do so.
                      Then we choose the <m>k</m>-member pizza-planning committee from the remaining <m>n-r</m> interested volunteers.

                <p permid="Cdm">
                  Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem.
                  You may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies.
                  Also, the cookies are all identical and the order in which you give out the cookies does not matter.
                </p>
                
                
                <p permid="GNf">
                  
                  All we really need to do is say when to switch from one kid to the next.
                  In terms of cookies,
                  we need to say after how many cookies do we stop giving cookies to the first kid and start giving
                  cookies to the second kid.
                  And then after how many do we switch to the third kid?
                  And after how many do we switch to the fourth?
                  So the way we'll represent an outcome is like this:
                  <me permid="UQK">
                    ***|*|*|**
                  </me>.

                  Three cookies go to the first kid,
                  then we switch and give one cookie to the second kid, then switch,
                  one to the third kid, switch, two to the fourth kid.
                  Notice that we need 7 stars and 3 bars
                  <ndash/>
                  one star for each cookie,
                  and one bar for each switch between kids,
                  so one fewer bars than there are kids
                  (we don't need to switch after the last kid
                  <ndash/>
                  we are done).

                <p permid="Tbx">
                  Why have we done all of this?
                  Simple: to count the number of ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids,
                  all we need to do is count how many
                  <em>stars and bars</em>
                  charts there are.

                  <idx><h>stars and bars</h><h>chart</h></idx>
                  is just a string of symbols, some stars and some bars.
                  If instead of stars and bars we would use 0's and 1's, it would just be a bit string.
                  <idx><h>bit string</h><h>relation to stars and bars</h></idx>
                  We know how to count those.
                  First, let's make sure we really know what we're doing.

                        What does it mean for no two cats to sit next to each other? It means we must place an owl between the first pair of cats and an owl between the second pair.
                        This leaves four owls to distribute between the 3 cats, or <m>\binom{4+2}{2} = 15</m> ways.

                This week, we look at some advanced counting techniques. We've also built in some catchup/review time, which will be useful for preparing for Exam 1 on Friday, March 5.
                This will be a 50-point exam covering Chapters 0 and 1. Expect a couple of short definitions followed by some straightforward questions covering sets, functions, and counting.

        Suppose now you have 13 pies and 7 children.
        No child can have more than 2 pies.
        How many ways can you distribute the pies?
      </p>
      <solution>
        <ol>
            <li>This is a stars and bars problem; there are <m>\binom{11+3}{3} = 364</m> ways to distribute the pies.</li>
            <li>Suppose Al gets 4 pies. Now he is guaranteed too many. There are 7 pies left to distribute among the four children; there are <m>\binom{7 + 3}{3} = 120</m> ways for Al to get too many pies. Since there are 4 children, there are <m>\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{10}{3}</m> ways for at least one child to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>Now suppose we give two children too many pies. There are <m>\binom{4}{2}</m> ways to choose the children. We'll give each four pies, leaving 3 to be distributed in <m>\binom{3+3}{3}</m> ways. There are then <m>\binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}</m> ways four two or more children to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>It is not possible for three or more kids to get too many pies; thus the number we calculated in the previous part was the number of ways for exactly two kids to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>There are <m>\binom{14}{3}</m> total ways to distribute the pies without restriction. There are <m>\binom{4}{1}\binom{10}{3}</m> ways that one or more kids get too many pies, but we are double-counting the situations in which two kids get too many pies. So we add back the number of times two kids get too many pies, <m>\binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}</m>:
            <me>
                \binom{14}{3} - \binom{4}{1}\binom{10}{3} + \binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}= 4.
            </me>
            This makes sense. The only way to ensure that no one is getting more than 3 is to give 3 to 3 kids and 2 to one. There are 4 ways to choose the kids who gets 2 pies.

            <p>
                Start by giving <em>one</em> kid 4 cookies. Then distribute the remaining 6 to all 5 kids with no restrictions. There are 5 choices for the kid who gets too many, and then <m>5\cdot\binom{10}{4}</m> ways to distribute the cookies<mdash />but be careful! We have counted the outcomes where two kids get at least four cookies multiple times. Thus, we need PIE. There are <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> ways to select which two kids will get spoiled. Then there are two cookies left to distribute to 5 kids, which can happen in <m>\binom{6}{4}</m> ways.

            <p>
                We are not able to give three kids four or more cookies, as we only have 10 to go around. Thus, the number of ways is:

            There are <m>5!</m> permutations in total. Then there are <m>\binom{5}{1}</m> choices for an element to fix, and <m>4!</m> ways to permute the other elements.
            But this will inevitably fix some of the four elements, so we've overcounted. 
            So let's get rid of the permutations that fix two elements: there are <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> choices for the two fixed elements, and 3! ways to permute the remaining elements. But this overcounts the permutations that fix 3 or more elements.

          We count all permutations, and subtract those which are not derangements.
          There are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations of 4 elements.
          Now for a permutation to <em>not</em> be a derangement,
          at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed.
          There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> choices for which single element we fix.
          Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements.

                Since the domain and codomain have the same cardinality, a function is surjective iff it is injective, so there are 120.
                Alternatively, a function that is not surjective must exclude one or more elements from the domain.
                There are <m>4^5</m> functions which exclude <m>1</m> (similarly, which exclude 2, 3, 4, or 5), so <m>5\cdot 4^5</m> functions which exclude at least 1 element. But we've overcounted, as usual, so we need to add some back in. There are <m>\binom{5}{2}\cdot 3^5</m> ways to exclude 2 or more elements, <m>\binom{5}{3} 2^5</m> ways to exclude 3 or more elements, and <m>\binom{5}{4}\cdot 1^5 = 5</m> ways to exclude four elements.

                There are <m>4^5</m> functions all together;
                we will subtract the functions which are not surjective.
                We could exclude any one of the four elements of the codomain,
                and doing so will leave us with <m>3^5</m> functions for each excluded element.
                This counts too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two of the four elements of the codomain,
                each pair giving <m>2^5</m> functions.
                But this excludes too many,
                so we add back in the functions which exclude three of the four elements of the codomain,
                each triple giving <m>1^5</m> function.
                There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> groups of functions excluding a single element,
                <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> groups of functions excluding a pair of elements,
                and <m>{4 \choose 3}</m> groups of functions excluding a triple of elements.
                This means that the number of functions which are
                <em>not</em> surjective is:
                <me permid="Liq">

                We can now say that the number of functions which are surjective is:
                <me permid="rpz">
                  4^5 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5\right]

            <li permid="wQq">
              <p permid="HZp">
                The number of surjective functions is:

                </me>.
                We took the total number of functions <m>5^5</m> and subtracted all that were not surjective.
                There were <m>{5 \choose 1}</m> ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range,
                and for each there were <m>4^5</m> functions.
                But this double counts,
                so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range:
                there are <m>{5 \choose 2}</m> choices for the two elements to exclude,
                and for each pair, <m>3^5</m> functions.
                This takes out too many functions,
                so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range:
                <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> choices for which three to exclude,
                and then <m>2^5</m> functions for each choice of elements.
                Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the
                <m>{5 \choose 4}</m> choices of 4 elements.
              </p>

                If you happen to calculate this number precisely,
                you will get 120 surjections.
                That happens to also be the value of <m>5!</m>.
                This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function <m>f:X \to Y</m> with
                <m>\card{X} = \card{Y}</m> finite must necessarily be a bijection.
                The number of bijections is always <m>\card{X}!</m> in this case.
                What we have here is a <em>combinatorial proof</em>

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Intro to Sequences</title>
    
     <p permid="MRZ">
      A <term>sequence</term>
          <idx><h>sequence</h></idx>
      is simply an ordered list of numbers.
      For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <ellipsis/>.
      This is different from the set <m>\N</m> because,
      while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers,
      in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in.
      For this reason,
      when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
      <me permid="WlL">
        a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
      </me>.
      To refer to the <em>entire</em> sequence at once,
      we will write <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> or <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m>,
      or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just <m>(a_n)</m>
      (in which case we assume we start the sequence with <m>a_0</m>).
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>notation for</h></idx>
      <notation>
        <usage>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</usage>
        <description>the sequence <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots</m></description>
      </notation>

    </p>

    <p permid="sZi">
      We might replace the <m>a</m> with another letter,
      and sometimes we omit <m>a_0</m>, starting with <m>a_1</m>,
      in which case we would use
      <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> to refer to the sequence as a whole.
      The numbers in the subscripts are called <term>indices</term>
      (the plural of <term>index</term>).
    </p>

    <p permid="Zgr">
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>as function</h></idx>
      While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers,
      it is really a type of function.
      Specifically, the sequence
      <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> is a function with domain <m>\N</m> where <m>a_n</m> is the image of the natural number <m>n</m>.
      Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus.
      We can shift a sequence up or down,
      add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence.
      These are done exactly as you would for functions.
    </p>

    <p permid="FnA">
      That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful,
      we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.
    </p>

          We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers <m>(0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots)</m>, when we start with <m>n=0</m>, and the powers of 2: <m>(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots)</m>.

                Note that if subtract 1 from each term,
                we get the sequence <m>(T_n)</m>.
                So we have <m>b_n = T_n + 1</m>.
                Therefore a closed formula is <m>b_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1</m>.
                A quick check of the first few <m>n</m> confirms we have it right.

                Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is <m>c_n = a_n+1 = 2^n + 1</m>.
                If we try this though, we get
                <m>c_0 = 2^0 + 1 = 2</m> and <m>c_1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3</m>.
                We are off because the indices are shifted.
                What we really want is <m>c_n = a_{n+1}+1</m> giving <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.

                Notice that all these terms are even.
                What happens if we factor out a 2?
                We get <m>(T_n)</m>!
                More precisely, we find that <m>d_n/2 = T_n</m>,
                so this sequence has closed formula <m>d_n = n(n+1)</m>.

                These are all triangular numbers.
                However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term.
                So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <m>T_n</m>,
                we would be set.
                Therefore the closed formula is
                <m>e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}</m> (where <m>n+3</m> came from <m>(n+2)+1</m>).
                Thinking about sequences as functions,
                we are doing a horizontal shift by 2:
                <m>e_n = T_{n+2}</m> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.

                Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2.
                You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term
                (the powers of 2 are <em>exactly</em>
                twice the previous term).
                Closed formula: <m>f_n = 2^{n} - 1</m>.

                These numbers are also doubling each time,
                but are also all multiples of 3.
                Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis/>.
                Aha.
                We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

                To get from one term to the next,
                we almost double each term.
                So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>.
                Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.
                So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m>
                (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>,
                not <m>2^0</m>).
                Alternatively,
                we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example:
                starting with 3, 5, 9, 17,
                <ellipsis/> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence.
                That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.
                Our sequence here would be twice this,
                so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as we got before.
              </p>

            <li permid="TcK">

                <m>(15, 33, 57, 87, 123, \ldots)</m>.
                Try dividing each term by 3.
                That gives the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots</m>.
                Now add 1 to each term: <m>6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots</m>,
                which is <m>(d_n)</m> in this example,
                except starting with 6 instead of 0.
                So let's start with the formula <m>d_n= n(n+1)</m>.
                To start with the 6, we shift: <m>(n+2)(n+3)</m>.
                But this is one too many, so subtract 1:
                <m>(n+2)(n+3) - 1</m>.
                That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3.
                So we want <m>j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)</m>.

              Indeed, the sequence of first differences is <m>1,4,7, 10, 13,\ldots</m>,
              which itself has differences <m>3,3,3,3,\ldots</m>.
              Thus <m>2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37,\ldots</m> is a <m>\Delta^2</m>-constant sequence.

    <p>
        This should remind us of something that you perhaps observed in calculus: the <m>n</m>th derivative of a degree <m>n</m> polynomial is constant.
    </p>


    <example permid="qHs">
      <statement>
        <p permid="jMN">
          Find a formula for the sequence <m>3, 7, 14, 24,\ldots</m>.

      <solution permid="byu">
        <p permid="mHt">
          First, check to see if the formula has constant differences at some level.
          The sequence of first differences is <m>4, 7, 10, \ldots</m> which is arithmetic,
          so the sequence of second differences is constant.
          The sequence is <m>\Delta^2</m>-constant,
          so the formula for <m>a_n</m> will be a degree 2 polynomial.
          That is, we know that for some constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
          and <m>c</m>,
          <me permid="qlT">

        <p permid="SOC">
          Now to find <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
          First, it would be nice to know what <m>a_0</m> is,
          since plugging in <m>n = 0</m> simplifies the above formula greatly.
          In this case, <m>a_0 = 2</m>
          (work backwards from the sequence of constant differences).
          Thus
          <me permid="Wtc">
            a_0 = 2 = a\cdot 0^2 + b \cdot 0 + c
          </me>,
          so <m>c = 2</m>.
          Now plug in <m>n =1</m> and <m>n = 2</m>.
          We get

          At this point we have two (linear) equations and two unknowns,
          so we can solve the system for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>

          We find <m>a = \frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>b = \frac{-1}{2}</m>,

          This sum telescopes.
          We are left with only the <m>-a_0</m> from the first equation and the <m>a_n</m> from the last equation.
          Putting this all together we have

          But we know that <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
          So the solution to the recurrence relation,

        This example works in part because there are the same number of <m>a_n</m>'s as <m>a_{n-1}</m>'s.

            Two observations worth making: first, this technique requires each term in the recurrence relation involve a previous term, i.e., the recurrence must be <term>homogeneous</term>. Second, if the characteristic polynomial has a repeated root, then we won't be able to find solutions for all initial conditions with the general form; it's underdetermined.

     <p permid="dJg">
      Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:

            <idx><h>induction</h></idx>
        Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: <q>Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement<ellipsis/></q> To prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, you must prove two facts:

        <ol permid="zcP">

            <p permid="oDK">
	      <idx><h>base case</h></idx>
	      <idx><h>induction</h><h>base case</h></idx>
              Base case: Prove that <m>P(0)</m> is true.
              You do this directly.
              This is often easy.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li permid="jTR">
            <p permid="UKT">
	      <idx><h>inductive case</h></idx>
	      <idx><h>induction</h><h>inductive case</h></idx>
              Inductive case: Prove that
              <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for all <m>k \ge 0</m>.
              That is, prove that for any <m>k \ge 0</m> if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
              then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
              This is the proof of an if
              <ellipsis/> then
              <ellipsis/> statement,
              so you can assume <m>P(k)</m> is true (<m>P(k)</m> is called the
              <em>inductive hypothesis</em>).
                <idx><h>inductive hypothesis</h></idx>
            You must then explain why <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true, given that assumption.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p permid="Ibc">
        Assuming you are successful on both parts above,
        you can conclude,
        <q>Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction,
        the statement <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.</q>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="JQp">
      Sometimes the statement <m>P(n)</m> will only be true for values of <m>n \ge 4</m>,
      for example, or some other value.
      In such cases, replace all the 0's above with 4's
      (or the other value).
    </p>

    <p permid="pXy">
      The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid.
      Why does induction work?
      Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges.
      We want to argue that in a minute,
      all the dominoes will have fallen down.
      For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino.
      That is the base case.
      It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls,
      it will cause the next domino to fall.
      That is the inductive case.
      If both of these conditions are met,
      you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall,
      then all the dominoes will fall.
    </p>

    <p permid="WeH">
      Induction is powerful!
      Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself.
      You just start the chain reaction,
      and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.
    </p>

    <p permid="ClQ">
      Think about our study of sequences.
      It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas.
      Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case.
      That is what is so great about induction.
      Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for <m>n</m>,
      we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.
    </p>

    <p permid="isZ">
      When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction,
      you should first think about <em>why</em> the statement is true,
      using inductive reasoning.
      Explain why induction is the right thing to do,
      and roughly why the inductive case will work.
      Then, sit down and write out a careful,
      formal proof using the structure above.

        <title>Examples</title>
        
        
        <example permid="sDJ">
      <statement>
        <p permid="SAh">
          Prove for each natural number <m>n \ge 1</m> that <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution permid="JBU">
        <p permid="Ngu">
          First, let's think inductively about this equation.
          In fact, we know this is true for other reasons
          (reverse and add comes to mind).
          But why might induction be applicable?
          The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to <m>n</m>.
          If we know how to do that,
          adding just one more term (<m>n+1</m>) would not be that hard.
          For example, if <m>n = 100</m>,
          suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is <m>5050</m>
          (so <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050</m>, which is true).
          Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers,
          it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050,
          instead of computing the entire sum again.
          We would have <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151</m>.
          In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term.
          This is why we should use induction.
        </p>

        <proof permid="pJd">
          <p permid="ZuM">
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.
            We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 1</m>.
          </p>

          <p permid="FBV">
            Base case: <m>P(1)</m> is the statement
            <m>1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}</m> which is clearly true.
          </p>

          <p permid="lJe">
            Inductive case: Let <m>k \ge 1</m> be a natural number.
            Assume (for induction) that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
            That means <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}</m>.
            We will prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
            That is, we must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}</m>.
            To prove this equation,
            start by adding <m>k+1</m> to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:
            <me permid="NuP">
              1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)
            </me>.
          </p>

          <p permid="RQn">
            Now, simplifying the right side we get:
            <md permid="lXz">
              <mrow>\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k+1 \amp = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = \frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2}</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>

          <p permid="xXw">
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true,
            so by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 1</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the following <q>proof</q> by induction of the statement:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Every cat is the same color.
            </blockquote>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    We'll rephrase this as <q>for every <m>n\ge 1</m>, any collection of <m>n</m> cats has the same color</q>.
                    Then, we just need to take <m>n</m> large enough to contain all cats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start with a collection of <m>n=1</m> cats.
                    Clearly every cat in the collection has the same color as the others, so we are done with the base case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the inductive case, assume that whenever we have a collection of <m>k</m> cats, they all have the same color.
                    Consider a collection of <m>k+1</m> cats, and put them all in a line (cats are very good listeners).
                    By the inductive hypothesis, we know the first <m>k</m> cats, ignoring the last one, have the same color.
                    Also by the inductive hypothesis, the last <m>k</m> cats, ignoring the first one, have the same color.
                    Thus, the first and last cats have the same color as some cat in the middle, so all <m>k+1</m> cats must have the same color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, any collection of <m>n</m> cats has the same color.

          First, the idea:
          if we take some number <m>n</m>, maybe it is prime.
          If so, we are done.
          If not, then it is composite,
          so it is the product of two smaller numbers.
          Each of these factors is smaller than <m>n</m>
          (but at least 2),
          so we can repeat the argument with these numbers.
          We have reduced to a smaller case.

            We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

          <p permid="kDL">
            Base case: <m>P(2)</m> is true because <m>2</m> is indeed prime.

            Inductive case: assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt n</m>.

            That is, we want to show that <m>n</m> is either prime or is the product of primes.
            If <m>n</m> is prime, we are done.
            If not, then <m>n</m> has more than 2 divisors,
            so we can write <m>n = m_1 \cdot m_2</m>,

            In either case,

          If not, let <m>2^x</m> be the largest power of 2 strictly less than <m>n</m>.
          Consider <m>n - 2^x</m>,
          which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both <m>n</m> and <m>2^x</m>.
          Thus <m>n-2^x</m> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be <m>2^x</m>,

        <title>Truth Tables and Logical Equivalence</title>
        
    <p>
        Mathematical propositions are often stated in conditional or biconditional form. However, we have seen that they can be more complicated than this. The premises or conclusion (or both!) of the proposition could have multiple substatements joined by connectives.
        How do we know if a given complex proposition is true?
        Formally, we decide the truth value of the proposition purely in terms of the truth values of the premises, conclusions, and the structure of the connectives joining them.
        Thus, it is helpful to understand the truth values of the logical connectives themselves.
    </p>

    
    <p permid="meq">
      Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected,
      all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives.
      Here they are:

    <title>Predicate Logic</title>
    
     <p permid="ERO">
      As we saw at the beginning of the semester,
      not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone.
      For example, we might want to work with the statement:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="GsG">
      <p permid="Wly">
        All primes greater than 2 are odd.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="kYX">
      To write this statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers.
      We can translate as follows:
      <me permid="usJ">
        \forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x))
      </me>.
      In this case, we are using <m>P(x)</m> to denote
      <q><m>x</m> is prime</q>
      and <m>O(x)</m> to denote <q><m>x</m> is odd.</q>
      These are not propositions,
      since their truth value depends on the input <m>x</m>.
      Better to think of <m>P</m> and <m>O</m> as denoting
      <em>properties</em> of their input.
      The technical term for these is <term>predicates</term>
      and when we study them in logic,
      we need to use <term>predicate logic</term>.
    </p>
    
    <example permid="MhS">
      <statement>
        <p permid="fFk">
          Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number.
          We can translate this into symbols as
          <me permid="azS">
            \neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
          </me>
          (literally, <q>it is not true that there is a number <m>x</m> such that for all numbers <m>y</m>,
          <m>x</m> is less than or equal to <m>y</m></q>).
        </p>

        <p permid="LMt">
          However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers:
          we can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type
          (between universal and existential).
          So the statement above should be
          <em>logically equivalent</em> to
          <me permid="GHb">
            \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
          </me>.
          Notice that <m>y \lt x</m> is the negation of <m>x \le y</m>.
          This literally says,
          <q>for every number <m>x</m> there is a number <m>y</m> which is smaller than <m>x</m>.</q>
          We see that this is another way to make our original claim.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example permid="spb">
      <statement>
        <p permid="rTC">
          Can you switch the order of quantifiers?
          For example, consider the two statements:
          <me permid="mOk">
            \forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y)
          </me>.
          Are these logically equivalent?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="hPW">
        <p permid="Zge">
          These statements are NOT logically equivalent.
          To see this,
          we should provide an interpretation of the predicate <m>P(x,y)</m> which makes one of the statements true and the other false.
        </p>

        <p permid="Fnn">
          Let <m>P(x,y)</m> be the predicate <m>x \lt y</m>.
          It is true, in the natural numbers,
          that for all <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> greater than that <m>x</m>
          (since there are infinitely many numbers).
          However, there is not a natural number <m>y</m> which is greater than every number <m>x</m>.
          Thus it is possible for <m>\forall x \exists y P(x,y)</m> to be true while <m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m> is false.
        </p>

        <p permid="luw">
          We cannot do the reverse of this though.
          If there is some <m>y</m> for which every <m>x</m> satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>,
          then certainly for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> which satisfies <m>P(x,y)</m>.
          The first is saying we can find one <m>y</m> that works for every <m>x</m>.
          The second allows different <m>y</m>'s to work for different <m>x</m>'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same <m>y</m> that work for every <m>x</m>.
          In other words,
          while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements,
          we do have a valid deduction rule:
        </p>

        <sidebyside permid="Ywk">

          <tabular halign="center" permid="Zuz">
            <row bottom="minor">
              <cell/>
              <cell><m>\exists y \forall x P(x,y)</m></cell>

          </tabular>

        </sidebyside>

        <p permid="RBF">
          Put yet another way, this says that the single statement
          <me permid="SVt">
            \exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
          </me>
          is always true.
          This is sort of like a tautology,
          although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic.
          A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a <term>law of logic</term>
              <idx>law of logic</idx>
          (or sometimes <term>logically valid</term>,
              <idx><h>logically valid</h><see>law of logic</see></idx>
          but that is less fun).

        There are three main styles of proof we'll discuss (aside from combinatorial and inductive proofs, which we've already looked at): <term>direct proofs</term>, <term>proofs by contradiction</term>, and <term>proofs by contrapositive</term>. Direct proofs are the most common, while proofs by contradiction are perhaps the most fun, and proofs by contrapositive feel a bit like magic. There are other special techniques as well, and we'll discuss them as we encounter examples of them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Before looking at some examples, let's consider two definitions.

                Let <m>a,b\in\Z</m>. We say <m>a</m> <term>divides</term> <m>b</m>, written <m>a | b</m>, if there exist <m>c\in\Z</m> such that <m>ac = b</m>.
                In this case, we say that <m>b</m> is a <term>multiple</term> of <m>a</m> and that <m>b</m> is <term>divisible</term> by <m>a</m>.
            </p>

    <definition>

                We say an integer <m>m\in\Z</m> is <term>even</term> if <m>m</m> is divisible by 2, i.e., there exists <m>k\in\Z</m> such that <m>m = 2k</m>.
                We say an integer <m>n\in\Z</m> is <term>odd</term> if <m>n</m> is not divisible by 2, i.e., there exists <m>j\in\Z</m> such that <m>n = 2j+1</m>.
            </p>

                        For all real numbers <m>x,y</m>, if <m>x</m> is irrational and <m>y</m> is rational, then <m>x+y</m> is irrational.

                        <p>
                           Proof: We will use a proof by contradiction. So we assume that the proposition is false, which means there exist real numbers <m>x,y</m> where <m>x\notin \Q</m>, <m>y\in \Q</m>, and <m>x+y\in \Q</m>. Since the rational numbers are closed under subtraction and <m>x+y,y\in\Q</m>, we see that
                           
                           <me>
                            (x+y)-y\in\Q.
                            </me>
                            However, <m>(x+y)-y = x</m>, and hence we can conclude that <m>x\in\Q</m>. This is a contradiction to the assumption that <m>x\notin \Q</m>. Therefore, the proposition is false, and we have proven that for all real numbers <m>x,y</m>, if <m>x</m> is irrational and <m>y</m> is rational, then <m>x+y</m> is irrational.

                        </p>

                    <p>
                        For each real number <m>x</m>, <m>x(1-x) \le \frac{1}{4}</m>.
                    </p>
                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            A proof by contradiction will be used. So we assume the proposition is false. This means that there exists a real number <m>x</m> such that <m>x(1-x) \gt \frac{1}{4}</m>. If we multiply both sides of this inequality by <m>4</m>, we obtain <m>4x(1-x) > 1</m>. However, if we let <m>x=3</m>, we then see that 
                            <md>
                                <mrow> 4x (1-x) \amp \gt 1</mrow>
                                <mrow>4\cdot 3(1-3) \amp\gt 1 </mrow>
                                <mrow>-12 \amp \gt 1. </mrow>
                            </md>
                            The last inequality is clearly a contradiction and so we have proved the proposition.

                        </p>

    <title>Proof by Contrapositive</title>

        <p permid="pga">
          Is the statement <q>for all integers <m>n</m>,
          if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even</q> true?

      <!-- 
<solution permid="cDn">
        <p permid="chO">
          This is the converse of the statement we proved above using a direct proof.
          From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears to be true.
          So let's prove it.
        </p>

        <p permid="IoX">
          A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary <m>n</m> and assuming that <m>n^2</m> is even.
          But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about <m>n</m>.
          Just because <m>n^2 = 2k</m> does not in itself suggest how we could write <m>n</m> as a multiple of 2.
        </p>

        <p permid="owg">
          Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement.
          We get, for all integers <m>n</m>,
          if <m>n</m> is odd then <m>n^2</m> is odd.
          This looks much more promising.
          Our proof will look something like this:
        </p>

        <p permid="UDp">
          Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
          Suppose that <m>n</m> is not even.
          This means that
          <ellipsis/>.
          In other words
          <ellipsis/>.
          But this is the same as saying
          <ellipsis/>.
          Therefore <m>n^2</m> is not even.
        </p>

        <p permid="AKy">
          Now we fill in the details:
        </p>

        <proof permid="IKw">
          <p permid="gRH">
            We will prove the contrapositive.
            Let <m>n</m> be an arbitrary integer.
            Suppose that <m>n</m> is not even, and thus odd.
            Then <m>n= 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
            Now <m>n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1</m>.
            Since <m>2k^2 + 2k</m> is an integer,
            we see that <m>n^2</m> is odd and therefore not even.

      <!-- 
<solution permid="oRF">
        <p permid="MYQ">
          The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> from knowing something about <m>a+b</m>.
          On the other hand,
          if we know something about <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> separately,
          then combining them might give us information about <m>a+b</m>.
          The contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is:
          for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are even, then <m>a+b</m> is even.

    We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be
    <q>the same.</q> Actually,
    given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?
    Are the edge sets equal?
    We know what it means for sets to be equal,
    and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.

          G_1 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}\}); \qquad G_2 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,c\}, \{c, b\}\})

    </statement>
    <solution permid="XEm">
      <p permid="PEo">
        No.
        Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start.
        Also, both graphs have two edges.
        In the first graph, we have edges <m>\{a,b\}</m> and <m>\{b,c\}</m>,
        while in the second graph we have edges	<m>\{a,c\}</m> and 	<m>\{c,b\}</m>.
        Now we do have <m>\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}</m>,
        so that is not the problem.
        The issue is that <m>\{a,b\} \ne \{a,c\}</m>.
        Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal
        (as sets),
        the graphs are not equal
        (as graphs).

    An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices.

        However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges,
        they <em>might</em> be isomorphic
        (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).
      </p>

      <p permid="ogY">
        We can try to build an isomorphism.
        How about we say <m>f(a) = b</m>,
        <m>f(b) = c</m>, <m>f(c) = d</m> and <m>f(d) = a</m>.
        This is definitely a bijection,
        but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism,
        we must make sure it <em>respects the edge relation</em>.
        In <m>G_1</m>,
        vertices <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are connected by an edge.
        In <m>G_2</m>, <m>f(a) = b</m> and
        <m>f(b) = c</m> are connected by an edge.
        So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges.
        The edge <m>\{a,c\}</m> in <m>G_1</m> corresponds to
        <m>\{f(a),
        f(c)\} = \{b,d\}</m>, but here we have a problem.
        There is no edge between <m>b</m> and <m>d</m> in <m>G_2</m>.
        Thus <m>f</m> is NOT an isomorphism.

      <p permid="Uoh">
        Not all hope is lost, however.
        Just because <m>f</m> is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all.
        We can try again.
        At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.

        Alternatively, notice that in <m>G_1</m>,
        the vertex <m>a</m> is adjacent to every other vertex.
        In <m>G_2</m>,
        there is also a vertex with this property: <m>c</m>.
        So build the bijection <m>g:V_1 \to V_2</m> by defining <m>g(a) = c</m> to start with.
        Next, where should we send <m>b</m>?
        In <m>G_1</m>,
        the vertex <m>b</m> is only adjacent to vertex <m>a</m>.
        There is exactly one vertex like this in <m>G_2</m>, namely <m>d</m>.
        So let <m>g(b) = d</m>.
        As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice:

        We should check that this really is an isomorphism.

    Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph,

    Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges from the larger graph.

    but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.

    Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them.
    If we add all possible edges,
    then the resulting graph is called <term>complete</term>.
    That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
    Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices,
    there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices.
    We give these a special name: <m>K_n</m>

    <notation>
      <usage>K_n</usage>
      <description>the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices</description>
    </notation>

    is the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices.

  <idx><h>graph</h><h>degree</h></idx>
    Each vertex in <m>K_n</m> is adjacent to <m>n-1</m> other vertices.
    We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the
    <term>degree</term> of that vertex.
    So every vertex in <m>K_n</m> has degree <m>n-1</m>.
    How many edges does <m>K_n</m> have?
    One might think the answer should be <m>n(n-1)</m>,
    since we count <m>n-1</m> edges <m>n</m> times
    (once for each vertex).
    However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices,
    so we counted every edge exactly twice.
    Thus there are <m>n(n-1)/2</m> edges in <m>K_n</m>.
    Alternatively, we can say there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> edges,
    since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <m>n</m> vertices.
  </p>

  <p permid="bxh">
    In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph,
    we can find the number of edges.
    The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be
    <em>twice</em> the number of edges,
    since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices.
    Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!

  <p permid="HEq">
    This is our first example of a general result about all graphs.  It seems innocent enough, but we will use it to prove all sorts of other statements.  So let's give it a name and state it formally.

    <proof>
        <p>
            We will use a combinatorial proof.
	    </p>
        <p>
	Suppose <m>V = \set{v_1,\ldots,v_n}</m>.
	We can create an <m>n\times n</m> matrix as follows: set the entry in row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m> to 1 if <m>v_i</m> is adjacent to <m>v_j</m> and 0 otherwise.
	We ask: how many 1s are in this matrix?
	
	Note that for every edge there are two 1s corresponding to the end points. Thus the answer is <m>2|E|</m>.
	
	Consider a given row of the matrix corresponding to <m>v_i</m>; there is a 1 in this row for each neighbor of <m>v_i</m>. Thus, the number of 1s in this row is exactly <m>d(v_i)</m>, so the number of 1s in the entire matrix is <m>\sum_{i=1}^n d(v_i)</m>.

  <p permid="nLz">
    The handshake lemma<fn>A <em>lemma</em> is a mathematical statement that is primarily of importance in that it is used to establish other results.</fn> is sometimes called the <em>degree sum formula</em>, and can be written symbolically as <me permid="pAM">
      \sum_{v\in V} d(v) = 2e

    <idx><h>vertex degree</h><h>degree sequence</h></idx>
    One use for the lemma is to actually find the number of edges in a graph.  To do this, you must be given the <term>degree sequence</term> for the graph (or be able to find it from other information).  This is a list of every degree of every vertex in the graph, generally written in non-increasing order.

  <example permid="JAH">
    <statement>
      <p permid="aNn">
        How many vertices and edges must a graph have if its degree sequence is <me permid="VHV">
          (4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1)

    </statement>
    <solution permid="PZN">
      <p permid="sQR">
        The number of vertices is easy to find: it is the number of degrees in the sequence: 7.  To find the number of edges, we compute the degree sum:
        <me permid="BPe">
          4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 20
        </me>,
        so the number of edges is half this: 10.

  <p permid="zZR">
    The handshake lemma also tells us what is not possible.  
  </p>

  <example permid="pHQ">
    <statement>
      <p permid="GUw">
        At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands.
        Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="wgW">
      <p permid="YYa">
        It seems like this should be possible.
        Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with.
        But this cannot happen.
        We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7.
        If such a graph existed,
        the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be <m>9\cdot 7 = 63</m>.
        This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with <m>31.5</m> edges.
        That is impossible.
        Thus at least one
        (in fact an odd number)
        of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an <em>even</em>
        number of people at the seminar.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p permid="gha">
    We can generalize the previous example to get the following proposition.<fn>A <term>proposition</term> is a general statement in mathematics, similar to a theorem, although generally of lesser importance.</fn>

  <proposition xml:id="prop-evensum" permid="YJF">
    <statement>
      <p permid="lms">
        In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.

    </statement>
    <proof permid="rxd">
      <p permid="Ffj">
        Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with odd degree.  Then the sum of the degrees in the graph would be odd, which is impossible, by the handshake lemma.

    One final definition: we say a graph is <term>bipartite</term>
    if the vertices can be divided into two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
    with no two vertices in <m>A</m> adjacent and no two vertices in <m>B</m> adjacent.
    The vertices in <m>A</m> can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in <m>B</m>.
    If each vertex in <m>A</m> is adjacent to all the vertices in <m>B</m>,
    then the graph is a <term>complete bipartite graph</term>,
    and gets a special name:
    <m>K_{m,n}</m>, where <m>|A| = m</m> and <m>|B| = n</m>.

      We wish to really understand trees.
      This means we should discover properties of trees;
      what makes them special and what is special about them.
    </p>

    <p permid="tWx">
      A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.
      Is there anything else we can say?
      It would be nice to have other equivalent conditions for a graph to be a tree.
      That is, we would like to know whether there are any graph theoretic properties that all trees have,
      and perhaps even that <em>only</em> trees have.
    </p>

    <p permid="adG">
      To get a feel for the sorts of things we can say, we will consider three <em>propositions</em> about trees.  These will also illustrate important proof techniques that apply to graphs in general, and happen to be a little easier for trees.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="GkP">
      Our first proposition gives an alternate definition for a tree.  That is, it gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a tree.

        <p permid="Nfu">
          This is an <q>if and only if</q> statement, so we must prove two implications.  We start by proving that if <m>T</m> is a tree, then between every pair of distinct vertices there is a unique path.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="tmD">
          Assume <m>T</m> is a tree, and let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be distinct vertices (if <m>T</m> only has one vertex, then the conclusion is satisfied automatically).  We must show two things to show that there is a unique path between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>: that there is a path, and that there is not more than one path.  The first of these is automatic, since <m>T</m> is a tree, it is connected, so there is a path between any pair of vertices.

          To show the path is unique, we suppose there are two paths between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, and get a contradiction.  The two paths might start out the same, but since they are different, there is some first vertex <m>u'</m> after which the two paths diverge.  However, since the two paths both end and <m>v</m>, there is some first vertex after <m>u'</m> that they have in common, call it <m>v'</m>.  Now consider the two paths from <m>u'</m> to <m>v'</m>.

                If <m>G_1</m> has a cycle, then remove <m>e_2</m> from the cycle to obtain <m>G_2</m>, which must still be connected. Continue in this way to obtain a connected graph <m>G_k</m> with no cycles, which must be a tree.
                Additionally, <m>G_k</m> is <m>G</m> with <m>k</m> edges removed, so it has <m>v-1-k</m> edges.
                However, since <m>G_k</m> has <m>v</m> vertices and is a tree, <xref ref="prop-tree-edge-vertex" />  must have <m>v-1</m> edges, which is a contradiction unless <m>k=0</m>, in which case <m>G</m> had no cycles to begin with.

    <title>Rooted Trees</title>
    
    <idx><h>rooted tree</h></idx>
    <idx><h>tree</h><h>rooted</h></idx>
    <p permid="jxs">
      So far, we have thought of trees only as a particular kind of graph.
      However, it is often useful to add additional structure to trees to help solve problems.
      Data is often structured like a tree.
      This book, for example, has a tree structure:
      draw a vertex for the book itself.
      Then draw vertices for each chapter,
      connected to the book vertex.
      Under each chapter, draw a vertex for each section,
      connecting it to the chapter it belongs to.
      The graph will not have any cycles; it will be a tree.
      But a tree with clear hierarchy which is not present if we don't identify the book vertex as the <q>top</q>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="PEB">
      <idx><h>root (in a tree)</h></idx>
      As soon as one vertex of a tree is designated as the <term>root</term>, then every other vertex on the tree can be characterized by its position relative to the root.  This works because there is a unique path between any two vertices in a tree.  So from any vertex, we can travel back to the root in exactly one way.  This also allows us to describe how distinct vertices in a rooted tree are related.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="vLK">
      <idx><h>parent (in a rooted tree)</h></idx>
      <idx><h>child (in a rooted tree)</h></idx>
      If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the <term>parent</term> of the other, which is called the <term>child</term> of the parent.  Of the two, the parent is the vertex that is closer to the root.  Thus the root of a tree is a parent, but is not the child of any vertex (and is unique in this respect: all non-root vertices have <em>exactly one</em> parent).  
    </p>
    
    <p permid="bST">
      <idx><h>descendant (in a rooted tree)</h></idx>
      <idx><h>ancestor (in a rooted tree)</h></idx>
      Not surprisingly, the child of a child of a vertex is called the <term>grandchild</term> of the vertex (and it is the <term>grandparent</term>).  More in general, we say that a vertex <m>v</m> is a <term>descendent</term> of a vertex <m>u</m> provided <m>u</m> is a vertex on the path from <m>v</m> to the root.  Then we would call <m>u</m> an <term>ancestor</term> of <m>v</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="Iac">
      <idx><h>sibling (in a rooted tree)</h></idx>
      For most trees (in fact, all except paths with one end the root), there will be pairs of vertices neither of which is a descendant of the other.  We might call these cousins or siblings.  In fact, vertices <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are called <term>siblings</term> provided they have the same parent.  Note that siblings are never adjacent (do you see why?).

      The key to how we partitioned the tree in the example was to know which vertex to assign to a set next.  We chose to visit all vertices in the same generation before any vertices of the next generation.

      In contrast, we could also have partitioned the tree in a different order.  Start with the root, put it in <m>A</m>.  Then look for one child of the root to put in <m>B</m>.  Then find a child of that vertex, into <m>A</m>, and then find its child, into <m>B</m>, and so on.  When you get to a vertex with no children, retreat to its parent and see if the parent has any other children.  So we travel as far from the root as fast as possible, then backtrack until we can move forward again.  This is called <term>depth first search</term>.

      Although we will not consider this in detail, these algorithms are usually applied to <em>weighted</em> graphs.  Here every edge has some weight or cost assigned to it.  The goal is to find a spanning tree that has the smallest possible combined weight.  Such a tree is called a <term>minimum spanning tree</term>.  Finding the minimum spanning tree uses basically the same algorithms as we described above, but when picking an edge to add, you always pick the smallest (or when removing an edge, you always remove the largest).<fn>

      If you add the smallest edge adjacent to edges you have already added, you are doing <em>Prim's algorithm</em>.  If you add the smallest edge in the entire graph, you are following <em>Kruskal's algorithm</em>.</fn>

        When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing,
        it is called <term>planar</term>.
        When a planar graph is drawn in this way,
        it divides the plane into regions called <term>faces</term>.

      When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross?
      If this <em>is</em> possible,
      we say the graph is <term>planar</term>
      (since you can draw it on the <em>plane</em>).
    </p>

      When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing,
      the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions.
      We will call each region a <term>face</term>.
      The graph above has 3 faces
      (yes, we <em>do</em> include the
      <q>outside</q> region as a face).
      The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph
      (as long as you do so without the edges crossing),
      so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property of the planar graph.
    </p>

      WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way.

      There is a connection between the number of vertices (<m>v</m>),
      the number of edges (<m>e</m>) and the number of faces (<m>f</m>) in any connected planar graph.
      This relationship is called Euler's formula.

      <proof>
        <p>
            Begin with our graph <m>G</m> and identify a spanning tree <m>T</m> of <m>G</m>. Let <m>v_T, e_T,  f_T</m> denote the corresponding number of each object of <m>T</m>.
            </p>
        <p>
            Observe that each time that we remove an edge of <m>G</m> not in <m>T</m>, two faces merge.
            When we break all cycles of <m>G</m> (leaving us with a tree), we have a single face.
            Thus, we remove <m>f-1</m> edges from <m>G</m> to achieve <m>T</m>, i.e., <me xml:id="eq-euler-formula-proof1">e - (f-1) = e_T</me>.
            Since <m>T</m> is a tree, we know that <m>e_T = v_T - 1</m>, so <m>v_T - e_T = 1</m>.
            The spanning tree has exactly one face, so <m>f_T = 1</m>, and adding these two together give us <m>v_T - e_T + f_T = 2</m>. Moreover, since <m>T</m> is a spanning tree, <m>v_T = v</m>. Substituting this and <xref ref="eq-euler-formula-proof1" /> into <m>v_T - e_T + f_T = 2</m> we have <m>v - (e-(f-1))+f_T = 2</m>, which simplifies to our desired result as <m>f_T = 1</m>.

      </statement>
      <proof permid="Yvx">
      <p permid="mzc">
        The proof is by contradiction.
        So assume that <m>K_5</m> is planar.
        Then the graph must satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. <m>K_5</m> has 5 vertices and 10 edges,
        so we get
        <me permid="NAT">
          5 - 10 + f = 2

        which says that if the graph is drawn without any edges crossing,
        there would be <m>f = 7</m> faces.
      </p>

      <p permid="SGl">
        Now consider how many edges surround each face.
        Each face must be surrounded by at least 3 edges.
        Let <m>B</m> be the total number of <em>boundaries</em>
        around all the faces in the graph.
        Thus we have that <m>3f \le B</m>.
        But also <m>B = 2e</m>,
        since each edge is used as a boundary exactly twice.
        Putting this together we get
        <me permid="tIc">
          3f \le 2e
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="yNu">
        But this is impossible,
        since we have already determined that <m>f = 7</m> and <m>e = 10</m>,
        and <m>21 \not\le 20</m>.
        This is a contradiction so in fact <m>K_5</m> is not planar.

        Again, we proceed by contradiction.
        Suppose <m>K_{3,3}</m> were planar.

      <p permid="LbM">
        How many boundaries surround these 5 faces?
        Let <m>B</m> be this number.
        Since each edge is used as a boundary twice, we have <m>B = 2e</m>.
        Also, <m>B \ge 4f</m> since each face is surrounded by 4 or more boundaries.
        We know this is true because <m>K_{3,3}</m> is bipartite,
        so does not contain any 3-edge cycles.

        A famous problem in graph theory is as follows:

    <blockquote permid="NWf">
      <p permid="XpR">
        Given any map of countries, states, counties,
        etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?

      <idx><h>graph</h><h>chromatic number</h></idx>
      In general, given any graph <m>G</m>,
      a coloring of the vertices is called
      (not surprisingly)
      a <term>vertex coloring</term>.
      If the vertex coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently,
      then the coloring is called <term>proper</term>.
      Every graph has a proper vertex coloring.
      For example,
      you could color every vertex with a different color.
      But often you can do better.
      The smallest number of colors needed to get a proper vertex coloring is called the

      It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get.

      So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question?
      If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large,

      The key observation is that while it is true that for any number <m>n</m>,
      there is a graph with chromatic number <m>n</m>,
      only some graphs arrive as representations of maps.
      If you convert a map to a graph,
      the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries.
      So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross.
      In other words,
      the graphs representing maps are all <em>planar</em>!

      One reasonable guess for an upper bound on the chromatic number is <m>\chi(G) \le \Delta(G) + 1</m>.
      Why is this reasonable?
      Starting with any vertex,

      Now fan out!
      At any point, if you consider an already colored vertex,
      some of its neighbors might be colored, some might not.
      But no matter what,
      that vertex and its neighbors could all be colored distinctly,

        There is a nice result which determines when a graph has a Euler path or circuit.
        To prove it, we need a bit more background.

                Let <m>G</m> be a graph.
                A vertex <m>v\in V(G)$</m> is called a <term>cut vertex of <m>G</m></term> provided <m>G\setminus v</m> (that is, <m>G</m> with <m>v</m> and any incident edges removed) has more components than <m>G</m>.

                Similarly, an edge <m>e\in E(G)</m> is called a <term>cut edge of <m>G</m></term> provided <m>G\setminus e</m> has more components than <m>G</m>.

            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph all of whose vertices have even degree.

                Then <m>G\setminus e</m> has two components, and each of these components contain exactly one vertex of odd degree, contradicting the handshake lemma.

    <lemma xml:id="lem-two-odd-cut-edge">

                Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph with exactly two vertices of odd degree.
                Let <m>a</m> be a vertex of odd degree and suppose <m>d(a)\ne 1</m>.
                Then at least one of the edges incident with <m>a</m> is not a cut edge.

        <proof>
            <p>
                Suppose for a contradiction that all edges incident with <m>a</m> are cut edges.
                Let <m>b</m> be the other vertex of odd degree in <m>G</m>.

                This graph has exactly two components.
                Since the path <m>P</m> does not use <m>e</m>, vertices <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in the same component.

                This means that, in  <m>G'</m>, there is exactly one vertex of odd degree, which is a contradiction.

    <theorem>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph.
                If every vertex of <m>G</m> has even degree, then for any <m>v\in V(G)</m>, there is an Euler circuit that begins and ends at <m>v</m>.
                Alternatively, if <m>G</m> has exactly two vertices of odd degree, say <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, there is an Euler path that begins at <m>a</m> and ends at <m>b</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
            <p>
                We go by induction on the number <m>e</m> of edges of <m>G</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                When <m>e=0</m>, have only vertices of even degree and a trivial Euler circuit, so the statement is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the induction hypothesis, suppose <m>G</m> has <m>m</m> edges and satisfies the theorem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now suppose that <m>G</m> is connected with <m>m+1</m> edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Suppose all of the vertices of <m>G</m> have even degree.</em>
                Let <m>v\in V(G)</m> be arbitrary and let <m>w</m> be a neighbor of <m>v</m>.
                Consider the graph <m>G' = G\setminus vw</m>.
                By <xref ref="lem-even-deg-cut-edge" />, <m>G'</m> is connected and has exactly two vertices of odd degree.
                By induction, there is an Euler path from <m>v</m> to <m>w</m>.
                If we add <m>vw</m> to the end of this path, we have found an Euler circuit of <m>G</m> that begins and ends at <m>w</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Now suppose that <m>G</m> has exactly two vertices of odd degree, say <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</em>
                We seek an Euler path that begins at <m>a</m> and ends at <m>b</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose first that <m>d(a) = 1</m>.
                In this case, <m>a</m> has exactly one neighbor, <m>x</m>.
                It is possible that <m>x = b</m> or <m>x\ne b</m>; we'll check both possibilities.
                First, let <m>G' = G\setminus a</m>.
                Notice that <m>d(x)</m> drops by 1, while all other vertices have the same degree as before.
                Also note that <m>G</m> has <m>m</m> edges and is connected.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If <m>x=b</m>, then all vertices in <m>G'</m> have even degree.
                        Therefore, by induction, <m>G'</m> has an Euler circuit <m>W</m> that begins and ends at <m>b</m>.
                        If we insert the edge <m>ab</m> at the beginning of <m>W</m>, we have constructed an Euler path that begins at <m>a</m> and ends at <m>b</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If <m>x\ne b</m>, then <m>G'</m> has exactly two vertices of odd degree (<m>x</m> and <m>b</m>) and <m>m</m> edges. Thus by induction there is an Euler path <m>W</m> that begins at <m>x</m> and ends at <m>b</m>. If we prepend the edge <m>ax</m> to the beginning of <m>W</m> we have an Euler path that begins at <m>a</m> and ends at <m>b</m>.                    
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now suppose that <m>d(a) \gt 1</m>.
                Since <m>d(a)</m> is odd, we have <m>d(a) \ge 3</m>.
                By <xref ref="lem-two-odd-cut-edge" />, there is an edge <m>ax</m> that is not a cut edge.
                Let <m>G' = G\setminus ax</m>.
                As before, we consider the possibilities <m>x = b</m> and <m>x\ne b</m>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If <m>x=b</m>, then as before all vertices in <m>G'</m> have even degree, and we can form, by induction, an Euler circuit in <m>G'</m> that begins/ends at <m>b</m> and then prepend the edge <m>ab</m> to form the desired Euler path.                        
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If <m>x\ne b</m>, then as before we have exactly two vertices of odd degree in <m>G'</m>, namely <m>x</m> and <m>b</m>.
                        By induction, form in <m>G'</m> an Euler path that starts at <m>x</m> and ends at <m>b</m>.
                        We prepend the edge <m>ax</m> to complete the requisite Euler path in <m>G</m>.

      Suppose you wanted to tour Königsberg in such a way that you visit each land mass
      (the two islands and both banks)
      exactly once.
      This can be done.
      In graph theory terms,
      we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once.
      Such a path is called a <term>Hamilton path</term>
      (or <term>Hamiltonian path</term>).
      We could also consider <term>Hamilton cycles</term>,
      which are Hamilton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.

      It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices,
      so there are fewer requirements to be met.
      However, nobody knows whether this is true.
      There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path.
      For small graphs this is not a problem,
      but as the size of the graph grows,
      it gets harder and harder to check wither there is a Hamilton path.
      In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve;
      it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete.

    Suppose you have a bipartite graph <m>G</m>.
    This will consist of two sets of vertices <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> with some edges connecting some vertices of <m>A</m> to some vertices in <m>B</m>
    (but of course,
    no edges between two vertices both in <m>A</m> or both in <m>B</m>).
    A <term>matching of <m>A</m></term>
    is a subset of the edges for which each vertex of <m>A</m> belongs to exactly one edge of the subset,
    and no vertex in <m>B</m> belongs to more than one edge in the subset.
    In practice we will assume that <m>|A| = |B|</m>
    (the two sets have the same number of vertices)
    so this says that every vertex in the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the matching.<fn>
    Note: what we are calling a <em>matching</em>
    is sometimes called a <em>perfect matching</em>
    or <em>complete matching</em>.
    This is because in it interesting to look at non-perfect matchings as well.
    We will call those <em>partial</em> matchings.
    </fn></p>

  <p permid="Eol">
    Some context might make this easier to understand.
    Think of the vertices in <m>A</m> as representing students in a class,
    and the vertices in <m>B</m> as representing presentation topics.
    We put an edge from a vertex <m>a \in A</m> to a vertex <m>b \in B</m> if student <m>a</m> would like to present on topic <m>b</m>.
    Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic,
    so their vertex would have degree greater than 1.
    As the teacher,
    you want to assign each student their own unique topic.
    Thus you want to find a matching of <m>A</m>:
    you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic,
    and no topic gets matched to two students.
    </p>
  
    <p permid="QCD">
    One way <m>G</m> could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in <m>A</m> not adjacent to any vertex in <m>B</m>
    (so having degree 0).
    What else?
    What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others?
    Then after assigning that one topic to the first student,
    there is nothing left for the second student to like,
    so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0.
    Or what if three students like only two topics between them.
    Again, after assigning one student a topic,
    we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic.
    We can continue this way with more and more students.
<!-- \todo{write exercise asking for a proof by induction for this} -->
  </p>

  <p permid="wJM">
    It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of <m>n</m> students who as a group like <m>n-1</m> or fewer topics,
    then no matching is possible.
    This is true for any value of <m>n</m>,
    and any group of <m>n</m> students.

        <p>
            A bipartite graph <m>G = \set{A,B}</m> has a matching of <m>A</m> if and only if <m>|N(S)| \ge |S|</m> for all <m>S\subseteq A</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
        <p>
            First, a bit of terminology.
            We say that a matching <m>M</m> <term>saturates</term> a vertex <m>v</m> if there is an edge in <m>M</m> incident to <m>v</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume now that some matching <m>M</m> saturates every vertex of <m>A</m>.
            Let <m>W\subseteq A</m> be arbitrary and let <m>M(W)</m> denote the set of all vertices in <m>B</m> matched by <m>M</m> to <m>W</m>.
            By the definition of a matching, <m>|M(W)| = |W|</m>.
            But <m>M(W)\subseteq N(W)</m>, since all elements of <m>M(W)</m> are neighbors of <m>W</m>.
            So, <m>|N(W)| \ge | M(W)| = |W|</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now assume that there is no matching of <m>A</m> and we'll show that Hall's condition is violated for at least one subset <m>W\subseteq A</m>.
            Let <m>M</m> be a maximum matching and <m>u\in A</m> not saturated by <m>M</m>.
            Consider all <em>alternating paths</em> (paths in <m>G</m> alternately using edges outside and inside <m>M</m>) starting from <m>u</m>.
            Let the set of all points in <m>B</m> connected to <m>u</m> by these alternating paths be <m>Z</m> and the set of all points in <m>A</m> connected to <m>u</m> be these alternating paths (including <m>u</m> itself) be <m>W</m>.
            No maximal alternating path can end in a vertex in <m>B</m>, lest it would be an <em>augmenting path</em>, so that we could augment <m>M</m> to a strictly larger matching by toggling the status (belongs to <m>M</m> or not) of all the edges of the path.
            Thus every vertex in <m>Z</m> is matched by <m>M</m> to a vertex in <m>W\setminus \set{u}</m>.
            Conversely, every vertex <m>v\in W\setminus\set{u}</m> is matched by <m>M</m> to a vertex in <m>Z</m> (namely, the vertex preceding <m>v</m> on an alternating path ending at <m>v</m>).
            Thus, <m>M</m> provides a bijection of <m>W\setminus \set{u}</m> and <m>Z</m>, which implies that <m>|W| = |Z| + 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, <m>N(W)\subseteq Z</m>, so let <m>v\in B</m> be connected to a vertex <m>w\in W</m>.
            The edge <m>wv</m> must be in <m>M</m>, otherwise <m>u</m> reaches <m>w</m> via an alternating path not containing <m>v</m>, and we could take this alternating path ending in <m>w</m> and extend it with <m>v</m>, getting an augmenting path (which would again contradict the maximality of <m>M</m>).
            Hence <m>v\in Z</m>, and so <m>|N(W)| \le |Z| = |W| - 1 \lt |W|</m>.
            </p>

    <title>Intro to Generating Functions</title>
    
        <example permid="sIN">
      <statement>
        <p permid="IBF">
          What sequence is represented by the generating series <m>3 + 8x^2 + x^3 + \frac{x^5}{7} + 100x^6 + \cdots</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="EXf">
        <p permid="pOh">
          We just read off the coefficients of each <m>x^n</m> term.
          So <m>a_0 = 3</m> since the coefficient of <m>x^0</m> is 3
          (<m>x^0 = 1</m> so this is the constant term).
          What is <m>a_1</m>?
          It is NOT 8, since 8 is the coefficient of <m>x^2</m>,
          so 8 is the term <m>a_2</m> of the sequence.
          To find <m>a_1</m> we need to look for the coefficient of <m>x^1</m> which in this case is 0.
          So <m>a_1 = 0</m>.
          Continuing, we have <m>a_2 = 8</m>,
          <m>a_3 = 1</m>, <m>a_4 = 0</m>,
          and <m>a_5 = \frac{1}{7}</m>.
          So we have the sequence
          <me permid="ajK">
            3, 0, 8, 1, 0, \frac{1}{7}, 100, \ldots
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="VVq">
          Note that when discussing generating functions,
          we always start our sequence with <m>a_0</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    
        <p permid="RVr">
      Now you might very naturally ask why we would do such a thing.
      One reason is that encoding a sequence with a power series helps us keep track of which term is which in the sequence.
      For example, if we write the sequence
      <m>1, 3, 4, 6, 9, \ldots, 24, 41,\ldots</m> it is impossible to determine which term <m>24</m> is
      (even if we agreed that the first term was supposed to be <m>a_0</m>).
      However, if we wrote the generating series instead,
      we would have <m>1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 6x^3 + 9x^4 + \cdots + 24 x^{17} + 41 x^{18} + \cdots</m>.
      Now it is clear that 24 is the 17th term of the sequence
      (that is, <m>a_{17} = 24</m>).
      Of course to get this benefit we could have displayed our sequence in any number of ways,
      perhaps <m>\fbox{1}_0 \fbox{3}_1 \fbox{4}_2 \fbox{6}_3 \fbox{9}_4 \cdots \fbox{24}_{17}\fbox{41}_{18}\cdots</m>,
      but we do not do this.
      The reason is that the generating series looks like an ordinary power series
      (although we are interpreting it differently)
      so we can do things with it that we ordinarily do with power series such as write down what it converges to.
    </p>

    <p permid="ycA">
      For example, from calculus we know that the power series
      <m>1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!} + \cdots</m> converges to the function <m>e^x</m>.
      So we can use <m>e^x</m> as a way of talking about the sequence of coefficients of the power series for <m>e^x</m>.
      When we write down a nice compact function which has an infinite power series that we view as a generating series,
      then we call that function a <em>generating function</em>.
      In this example, we would say
      <me permid="GqT">
        1, 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{24}, \ldots, \frac{1}{n!}, \ldots \mbox{ has generating function }  e^x
      </me>.
    </p>
      
  </subsubsection>
  
  <subsubsection>
    <title>Building Generating Functions</title>
    <p permid="qyb">
      The <m>e^x</m> example is very specific.
      We have a rather odd sequence,
      and the only reason we know its generating function is because we happen to know the Taylor series for <m>e^x</m>.
      Our goal now is to gather some tools to build the generating function of a particular given sequence.
    </p>

    <p permid="WFk">
      Let's see what the generating functions are for some very simple sequences.
      The simplest of all: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, <ellipsis/>.
      What does the <em>generating series</em> look like?
      It is simply <m>1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \cdots</m>.
      Now, can we find a closed formula for this power series?
      Yes!
      This particular series is really just a geometric series with common ratio <m>x</m>.
      So if we use our <q>multiply,
      shift and subtract</q> technique from <xref ref="sec_seq-arithgeom"/>, we have
      <md permid="lsJ">
        <mrow>S \amp  = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\underline{-\qquad xS} \amp  \underline{\,\, = ~~~~~~ x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + \cdots}</mrow>
        <mrow>(1-x)S \amp  = 1</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p permid="CMt">
      Therefore we see that
      <me permid="myc">
        1 + x + x^2 + x^3 \cdots = \dfrac{1}{1-x}
      </me>.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="iTC">
      You might remember from calculus that this is only true on the interval of convergence for the power series,
      in this case when <m>|x| \lt 1</m>.
      That is true for us, but we don't care.
      We are never going to plug anything in for <m>x</m>,
      so as long as there is some value of <m>x</m> for which the generating function and generating series agree,
      we are happy.
      And in this case we are happy.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="bKC">
      <title><m>1,1,1,\ldots</m></title>
      <p permid="ejJ">
        The generating function for
        <m>1,1,1,1,1,1,\ldots</m> is <m>\dfrac{1}{1-x}</m>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="PaL">
      Let's use this basic generating function to find generating functions for more sequences.
      What if we replace <m>x</m> by <m>-x</m>.
      We get
      <me permid="SFl">
        \frac{1}{1+x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  1, -1, 1, -1, \ldots
      </me>.

    <p permid="vhU">
      If we replace <m>x</m> by <m>3x</m> we get

      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="bpd">
      By replacing the <m>x</m> in
      <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> we can get generating functions for a variety of sequences,
      but not all.
      For example,
      you cannot plug in anything for <m>x</m> to get the generating function for <m>2,2,2,2, \ldots</m>.
      However, we are not lost yet.
      Notice that each term of <m>2, 2, 2, 2, \ldots</m> is the result of multiplying the terms of <m>1, 1, 1, 1, \ldots</m> by the constant 2.
      So multiply the generating function by 2 as well.
      <me permid="eTD">
        \frac{2}{1-x} = 2 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  2, 2, 2, 2, \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Hwm">
      Similarly, to find the generating function for the sequence <m>3, 9, 27, 81, \ldots</m>,
      we note that this sequence is the result of multiplying each term of <m>1, 3, 9, 27, \ldots</m> by 3.
      Since we have the generating function for <m>1, 3, 9, 27, \ldots</m> we can say
      <me permid="LaM">
        \frac{3}{1-3x} = 3\cdot 1 + 3\cdot 3x + 3\cdot 9x^2 + 3\cdot 27x^3 + \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  3, 9, 27, 81, \ldots
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="nDv">
      What about the sequence <m>2, 4, 10, 28, 82, \ldots</m>?
      Here the terms are always 1 more than powers of 3.
      That is, we have added the sequences
      <m>1,1,1,1,\ldots</m> and <m>1,3,9, 27,\ldots</m> term by term.
      Therefore we can get a generating function by adding the respective generating functions:

        <mrow>2 + 4x + 10x^2 + 28x^3 + \cdots  \amp  = (1 + 1) + (1 + 3)x + (1 + 9)x^2 + (1 + 27)x^3 + \cdots</mrow>

      if we replace <m>x</m> in our original generating function by <m>x^2</m> we get
      <me permid="rhV">
        \frac{1}{1-x^2} = 1 + x^2  + x^4 + x^6\cdots \mbox{ which generates }  1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \ldots

      How could we get <m>0,1,0,1,0,1,\ldots</m>?
      Start with the previous sequence and
      <em>shift</em> it over by 1.
      But how do you do this?
      To see how shifting works,
      let's first try to get the generating function for the sequence <m>0, 1, 3, 9, 27, \ldots</m>.
      We know that <m>\frac{1}{1-3x} = 1 + 3x + 9x^2 + 27x^3 + \cdots</m>.
      To get the zero out front,
      we need the generating series to look like <m>x + 3x^2 + 9x^3 + 27x^4+ \cdots</m>
      (so there is no constant term).
      Multiplying by <m>x</m> has this effect.
      So the generating function for
      <m>0, 1, 3, 9, 27, \ldots</m> is <m>\frac{x}{1-3x}</m>.
      This will also work to get the generating function for <m>0,1,0,1,0,1,\ldots</m>:
      <me permid="Xpe">
        \frac{x}{1-x^2} = x + x^3 + x^5 + \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  0, 1, 0, 1, 0 , 1 \ldots

      What if we add the sequences
      <m>1,0,1,0,1,0,\ldots</m> and <m>0,1,0,1,0,1,\ldots</m> term by term?
      We should get <m>1,1,1,1,1,1\ldots</m>.
      What happens when we add the generating functions?
      It works (try it)!

    <p permid="Mgf">
      Here's a sneaky one: what happens if you take the
      <em>derivative</em> of <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m>?
      We get <m>\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}</m>.
      On the other hand,
      if we differentiate term by term in the power series,
      we get <m>(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots)' = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots</m> which is the generating series for <m>1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots</m>.

    <title>Differencing</title>
    <p permid="Yux">
      We have seen how to find generating functions from <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> using multiplication
      (by a constant or by <m>x</m>),
      substitution, addition, and differentiation.
      To use each of these, you must notice a way to transform the sequence
      <m>1,1,1,1,1\ldots</m> into your desired sequence.
      This is not always easy.
      It is also not really the way we have analyzed sequences.
      One thing we have considered often is the sequence of differences between terms of a sequence.
      This will turn out to be helpful in finding generating functions as well.
      The sequence of differences is often simpler than the original sequence.
      So if we know a generating function for the differences,
      we would like to use this to find a generating function for the original sequence.
    </p>

    <p permid="EBG">
      For example,
      consider the sequence <m>2, 4, 10, 28, 82, \ldots</m>.
      How could we move to the sequence of first differences:
      <m>2, 6, 18, 54,\ldots</m>?
      We want to subtract 2 from the 4, 4 from the 10, 10 from the 28, and so on.
      So if we subtract
      (term by term)
      the sequence <m>0, 2, 4, 10, 28,\ldots</m> from <m>2, 4, 10, 28\ldots</m>,
      we will be set.
      We can get the generating function for
      <m>0,2,4,10,28,\ldots</m> from the generating function for
      <m>2,4,10,28\ldots</m> by multiplying by <m>x</m>.
      Use <m>A</m> to represent the generating function for <m>2, 4, 10, 28, 82, \ldots</m> Then:

    <p permid="kIP">
      While we don't get exactly the sequence of differences,
      we do get something close.
      In this particular case, we already know the generating function <m>A</m>
      (we found it in the previous section)
      but most of the time we will use this differencing technique to <em>find</em> <m>A</m>:

      In each of the examples above,

      For example,
      if we know that the sequence satisfies the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}</m>?
      In other words,
      if we take a term of the sequence and subtract 3 times the previous term and then add 2 times the term before that, we get 0

      That will hold for all but the first two terms of the sequence.

            1 = a(1-2x) + b(1-x)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Qge">
          This must be true for all values of <m>x</m>.
          If <m>x = 1</m>,
          then the equation becomes <m>1 = -a</m> so <m>a = -1</m>.
          When <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m> we get <m>1 = b/2</m> so <m>b = 2</m>.
          This tells us that we can decompose the fraction like this:
          <me permid="MPZ">
            \frac{1}{(1-x)(1-2x)} = \frac{-1}{1-x} + \frac{2}{1-2x}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="wnn">
          This completes the partial fraction decomposition.
          Notice that these two fractions are generating functions we know.
          In fact, we should be able to expand each of them.
          <me permid="sXi">
            \frac{-1}{1-x} = -1 - x - x^2 -x^3 - x^4 - \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, \ldots
          </me>.
          <me permid="Zer">
            \frac{2}{1-2x} = 2 + 4x + 8x^2 + 16x^3 + 32x^4 + \cdots \mbox{ which generates }  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="cuw">
          We can give a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of each of these sequences.
          The first is just <m>a_n = -1</m>.
          The second is <m>a_n = 2^{n+1}</m>.
          The sequence we are interested in is just the sum of these,
          so the solution to the recurrence relation is
          <me permid="FlA">
            a_n = 2^{n+1} - 1
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="BHa">
      We can now add generating functions to our list of methods for solving recurrence relations.

        <title>Counting Techniques</title>
        
        <p>
            Throughout the course, we'll collect lots of ways to count things. However, they often seem really similar to one another, so in this appendix I will try to collect various archetypal problems and methodologies.
            This will be a work in progress.

            <p>
                First, recall the statements of the <xref ref="additive-principle" text="custom">Additive Principle</xref> and <xref ref="multiplicative-principle" text="custom">Multiplicative Principle</xref>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both involve independent events; the difference between the two is therefore the difference between <q>or</q> and <q>and</q>.
