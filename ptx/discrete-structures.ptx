      <title>A Note to Students</title>
      <p>
      This work was compiled with some strong opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The first is that, as with a sport, instrument, or nearly any other skill, you can't learn mathematics without doing mathematics. Thus, there are few worked-out examples in this book. We would rather spend a long time in productive struggle to understand an idea deeply than be spoon-fed solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second is that most people's ideas of what counts as a mathematical question are far too narrow. Mathematics is not merely geometry, algebra, and calculus (maybe with a dash of statistics for good measure). Mathematics is a way of thinking; it's about abstraction, deductive reasoning, and problem-solving. This way of thinking can be applied in surprising places, and can lead to delight and wonder at the world God has made. We will explore some of these questions this semester.

            Today's material comes from <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-statements.html">Section 0.2 of the book</url>, up through "Truth Conditions for Connectives". You're encouraged to read it before coming to class.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We'll begin with an overview of the class. Watch the screencast below and read the <url href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds">syllabus</url> for more information. Then, it's math time!
          </p>

            <idx><h>molecular statement</h></idx>
      
            Our first definition is that of a <term>statement</term>, which
            is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
            A statement is
            <term>atomic</term> if it cannot be divided into smaller statements,
            otherwise it is called
            <term>molecular</term>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                In groups of 2-3, determine whether the following are statements. Be sure you can explain your thinking!
                
                <ol>
                  <li>The integer 3 is odd. </li>
                \begin{solution}\blue{This is a statement, and it happens to be true.}\end{solution}

                  <li> There exists a real number such that <m>x^2 + 4x= 9</m>. </li>
                
                  <li> <m>x^2+4x=9</m>. </li>

                  <li> This is really difficult! </li>
                
                  <li> (Challenge) This statement is false.</li>

                 It is a well known law in the United States that you must be 16 years of age or older to drive a car without an adult present. Suppose now that four cards are placed on the table each of which has an age on one side and a vehicle on the other. The visible faces of the cards show 11, 17, a bicycle, and a car. If each card represents a person, which card(s) must you check to make sure everyone is a law abiding citizen? That is, which card(s) must you turn over to verify the proposition:

                 This exercise is practice with checking if a conditional statement is true. Consider the following conditional statement:
                 
                 <blockquote>
                   If I win the lottery, every student in this class gets an A.

                 In this conditional statement, what is the hypothesis and what is the conclusion?
                 Which of the following circumstances make the conditional statement bolded above false?

                When constructing proofs, it is sometimes helpful to prove the contrapositive of a conditional rather than the conditional itself. The downside of this approach is that we generally lose the causal chain; rather than explaining why statement <m>Q</m> follows from <m>P</m>, we show that <m>P</m> could not be true if <m>Q</m> were not. <aside>I recognize that this is pretty abstract! More details when we get to chapter 3.</aside>

                In order to make use of the work we've done on statements to do actual mathematics, we need a way of introducing variables.
                A sentence with a variable is known as a <term>predicate</term>.

              <p>
                Consider the sentence "<m>m</m> is composite". Is this true, false, or not a statement?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                What we need to do is specify a <emph>quantifier</emph> and <emph>domain of discourse</emph> for our variable. 
                In mathematics, we deal with two quantifiers: the existential quantifier and the universal quantifier.

              <p>
                Much of the time, quantifiers are relatively straightforward, even implied by a precise way of speaking.
                One exception to this is when we seek to negate a quantified statement.

      <introduction>
        <p>
            This week, we explore a few more mathematical preliminaries. We first dive into the things we can do with sets.
            Then, we move to relations and equivalence relations, foundational notions both for future work in matheamtics (even in this class).
            Our first portfolio problem is due on Wednesday; this is really an introduction to <m>\LaTeX</m>, the language in which we'll write our mathematical portfolio work.
            Also due Wednesday is an Edfinity assignment over <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html">Section 0.3</url>, and we'll take a weekly quiz over the notes on Friday.

                  <statement>
                    Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
                    The <term>union</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m>, is the set containing all elements <m>x</m> which are in <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> (or both).
                    The intersection <m>A\cap B</m> is the set of all elements of <m>x</m> in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

                </p>

              <p permid="SNP">
                Often when dealing with sets,
                we will have some understanding as to what <q>everything</q> is.
                Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers.
                In this case we would say that our
                <term>universe</term> is <m>\N</m>.
                <idx><h>universe set</h></idx>
                Sometimes we denote this universe by <m>\U</m>.
                Given this context,
                we might wish to speak of all the elements which are
                <em>not</em> in a particular set.
                We say <m>B</m> is the <term>complement</term>
                    <idx><h>complement of a set</h></idx>
                of <m>A</m>, and write,
                <me permid="Czy">
                  B = \bar A
                </me>
                when <m>B</m> contains every element not contained in <m>A</m>.
                So, if our universe is <m>\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}</m>,
                and <m>A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}</m>,
                then <m>\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}</m>.
              </p>
              
              <p permid="yUY">
                Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time.
                For example, consider
                <me permid="iGH">
                  A \cap \bar B
                </me>.

              <p permid="fch">
                This is the set of all elements which are both elements of <m>A</m> and not elements of <m>B</m>.
                What have we done?
                We've started with <m>A</m> and removed all of the elements which were in <m>B</m>.
                Another way to write this is the
                <term>set difference</term>:
                    <idx><h>set</h><h>difference</h></idx>
                    <idx><h>difference of sets</h></idx>

        <introduction>
          <p>
              This week, we are all about <term>functions</term>. The notion of function is a foundational idea in all fields of mathematics and related disciplines, from calculus to abstract algebra and everywhere in between, including the discrete ideas we'll explore this semester. So, this week we get a brief overview of what functions (defined more abstractly) are, as well as some of the properties they might have. Don't forget that the first reading reflection is due on Monday (Feb 1), and we'll discuss the reading in class on Wednesday.

                <p>
                  The definition of a function we supply here is slightly different than the <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html#sKa">definition given in the book</url>, as we have the language of relations that our book does not develop.

                    <p>
                      Let <m>X,Y</m> be nonempty sets.
                      A <term>function</term> (or <term>map</term>, or <term>mapping</term>) is a relation <m>f</m> on <m>X\times Y</m> in which each element <m>x\in X</m> is related to exactly one element <m>y\in Y</m>. We write <m>y = f(x)</m> and <m>f : X\to Y</m>. We say that <m>X</m> is the <term>domain</term> of <m>f</m>, <m>Y</m> is the <term>codomain</term> of <m>f</m>, <m>y</m> is the <term>image</term> of <m>x</m> under <m>f</m>, and the set <m>\ran(f) = \setof{y\in Y}{\exists x\in X, y=f(x)}</m> is the <term>range</term> of <m>f</m>.

                  Wow, that's a lot! Let's spend some time exploring this, first with an example.

                <title>Representations of Functions</title>
                
                <p>
                  <em>Definining</em> a function requires three elements: a domain, a codomain, and an assignment of each member of the domain to a unique member of the codomain.
                  As your experience suggests, there are several ways to <em>represent</em> that assignment, such as via a <q>rule</q> (e.g., those defined by algebraic expressions, though not all algebraic expressions define functions); via a graphical relationship; via a table, or in words (e.g., the birthday function).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  In this class, our domains and codomains will generally be discrete sets, such as <m>\N</m> or <m>\Z</m>, and very often they will be <em>finite sets</em>. This allows us to be more explicit about the assignments we make.
                </p>
                
                <example>
                  <statement>
                    <p>
                      Let's represent the functions described in <xref ref="example-functiondef" /> in as many ways as possible.

              Today's material comes from <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html">Section 0.4</url> of the book. You're encouraged to read it before coming to class. We'll also discuss the first five chapters of <em>Mathematics for Human Flourishing</em> following on the reading and reflection you recently completed, so please refresh your thoughts on that book as well.

                      <li>What is matheamtics? What connection do you see between doing mathematics and being human?</li>
                      <li>Think of a time you were captivated by exploring something. What analogies can you draw between doing math and doing this exploration?</li>
                      <li>How does abstraction enrich the meaning of an idea? Give an example from your own experiences.</li>
                      <li>Think of an activity you associate with play. Make a list of all the things you enjoy about its playful aspects. Does your list have analogies in mathematical activities?</li>
                      <li>What role does beauty have in the Christian life?</li>
                      <li>Where is mathematical beauty found in the world?</li>

                <title>Recursive Definitions of Functions</title>
                
                <p>
                  We've so far seen that we can define functions by listing ordered pairs, giving rules, drawing arrow diagrams, and the like. Another important method for defining functions (especially in computer science) is with a <term>recursive definition</term>.
                </p>
                
                <p permid="DSZ">
                  Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a
                  <q>real world</q> problem,
                  because they describe how the values of the functions are changing.
                  However, this comes with a price.
                  It is harder to calculate the image of a single input,
                  since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.

                  If images tell us where functions send elements and sets of the codomain, then <term>inverse images</term> (sometimes called <em>preimages</em>) describe which objects in the domain get sent to particular objects (elements, subsets) of the codomain. <aside>I differ from our book in preferring the term <q>preimage</q>; the inverse image of sets and elements in the codomain can be calculated even for functions which do not have inverses, and I find the double meaning of the word <q>inverse</q> annoying.</aside>

              This week, we investigate some counting problems with intentionality.
              We'll develop some principles for doing certain types of counting, and then see how far we can push them.

                Today we start counting. Well, you've been doing a form of counting your whole life, and we saw an initial example of the types of counting questions in which we'll be interested in <xref ref="expl-first-counting" />.
                Our counting questions will often take the form <q>How many possible <em>qrsabs</em> are there subject to the constraint <em>jkasdghjkl</em>, where the order of the <em>qrsabs</em> may/may not matter?</q> (And where these words are mostly made up).

                      <m>\{0, 1, \ldots, 9, \mathrm{A, B, C, D, E, F}\}</m>.
                      So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8.

                  (involving more than 3 sets).

                <p>
                  Here's another counting problem involving sets.
                  Given a set <m>A</m>, recall that the <em>power set of</em> <m>A</m>, denoted <m>\pow(A)</m>, is the set of all subsets of <m>A</m>.
                  Can we predict ahead of time how many subsets a set will have?
                  That is, given a set <m>A</m>, can we calculate <m>\card{\pow(A)}</m> if we know <m>\card{A}</m>?

                    In chess, a rook can move only in straight lines

                    in the upper left corner, can take to get to that square.
                    For example, one square is already filled in.
                    There are six different paths from the rook to the square: DDRR
                    (down down right right),
                    DRDR, DRRD, RDDR, RDRD and RRDD.

                  This can continue as far down as we like.
                  The recurrence relation for
                  <m>{n \choose k}</m> tells us that each entry in the triangle is the sum of the two entries above it.
                  The entries on the sides of the triangle are always 1.
                  This is because <m>{n \choose 0} = 1</m> for all <m>n</m> since there is only one way to pick 0 of <m>n</m> objects and
                  <m>{n \choose n} = 1</m> since there is one way to select all <m>n</m> out of <m>n</m> objects.
                  Using the recurrence relation,
                  and the fact that the sides of the triangle are 1's, we can easily replace all the entries above with the correct values of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
                  Doing so gives us <term>Pascal's triangle</term>.

                      Here is another way to find the number of <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements:
                      first select which <m>k</m> elements will be in the permutation,
                      then count how many ways there are to arrange them.
                      Once you have selected the <m>k</m> objects,
                      we know there are <m>k!</m> ways to arrange (permute) them.
                      But how do you select <m>k</m> objects from the <m>n</m>?
                      You have <m>n</m> objects, and you need to
                      <em>choose</em> <m>k</m> of them.
                      You can do that in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
                      Then for each choice of those <m>k</m> elements,
                      we can permute <em>them</em> in <m>k!</m> ways.
                      Using the multiplicative principle,

                      We say <m>P(n,k)</m> counts <em>permutations</em>,
                      and <m>{n \choose k}</m> counts <em>combinations</em>.
                      The formulas for each are very similar,
                      there is just an extra <m>k!</m> in the denominator of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
                      That extra <m>k!</m> accounts for the fact that
                      <m>{n \choose k}</m> does not distinguish between the different orders that the <m>k</m> objects can appear in.
                      We are just selecting
                      (or choosing)
                      the <m>k</m> objects, not arranging them.
                      Perhaps <q>combination</q> is a misleading label.
                      We don't mean it like a combination lock
                      (where the order would definitely matter).
                      Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors
                      <mdash/> you just need to decide which flavors to combine,
                      not the order in which to combine them.

                          Prof. Clark is once again getting ready to order pizzas for the next Pizza and Presentation. Recall from <xref ref="invest-pizzas" /> that there are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Three choices for crusts (thin, hand-tossed, thick)</li>
                          <li>Three choices for sauce (red, white, BBQ)</li>
                          <li>Fifteen choices for toppings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          How many different pizzas are possible if Prof. Clark can make one choice for crust, one choice for sauce, and then choose any number of toppings?
                        </p>

                      <solution>
                        <p>
                         The main problem is to figure out the number of choices for toppings.
                            We will assume no repeated toppings (or at least that, e.g., double pepperoni is the same as single pepperoni for the purposes of counting combinations of toppings).
                            We also assume that the order in which toppings are added does not matter (possibly contentious!).
                            Note that for <m>0 \le k \le 15</m>, there are <m>\binom{15}{k}</m> ways to make a <m>k</m>-topping pizza.
                            Then there are
                            <me>
                                3\cdot 3\cdot \sum\limits_{k=0}^{15} \binom{15}{k} = 294,912
                            </me>
                            
                            possible pizzas.

                  This is an example of a <term>combinatorial proof</term>, which seeks to establish an identity (that is, an equation) by asking a counting question, and answering it in two different ways. Since the two methods answer the same question, they must in fact be equal. We now explore some additional examples.

                      Suppose Prof. Clark, fresh off the success of Pizza and a Presentation, is looking to establish two committees of people interested in helping organize future versions: a pizza-planning committee for choosing the pizzas and consisting of <m>k</m> members; and a speaker-planning committee for choosing speakers and consisting of <m>r</m> members. A total of <m>n</m> people have expressed interest in serving on one of the committees, and Prof. Clark decides that no one should be on both committees. How many ways are there for him to assign members to the committees?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the one hand, there are <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> ways to construct the pizza-planning committee. Then, there are <m>n-k</m> volunteers remaining, so there are <m>\binom{n-k}{r}</m> ways to construct the speaker-planning committee and so <m>\binom{n}{k} \binom{n-k}{r}</m> ways of constructing both committees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      On the other hand, perhaps we construct the speaker-planning committee first; there are <m>\binom{n}{r}</m> ways to do so.
                      Then we choose the <m>k</m>-member pizza-planning committee from the remaining <m>n-r</m> interested volunteers.

                <p permid="Cdm">
                  Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem.
                  You may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies.
                  Also, the cookies are all identical and the order in which you give out the cookies does not matter.
                </p>
                
                
                <p permid="GNf">
                  
                  All we really need to do is say when to switch from one kid to the next.
                  In terms of cookies,
                  we need to say after how many cookies do we stop giving cookies to the first kid and start giving
                  cookies to the second kid.
                  And then after how many do we switch to the third kid?
                  And after how many do we switch to the fourth?
                  So the way we'll represent an outcome is like this:
                  <me permid="UQK">
                    ***|*|*|**
                  </me>.

                  Three cookies go to the first kid,
                  then we switch and give one cookie to the second kid, then switch,
                  one to the third kid, switch, two to the fourth kid.
                  Notice that we need 7 stars and 3 bars
                  <ndash/>
                  one star for each cookie,
                  and one bar for each switch between kids,
                  so one fewer bars than there are kids
                  (we don't need to switch after the last kid
                  <ndash/>
                  we are done).

                <p permid="Tbx">
                  Why have we done all of this?
                  Simple: to count the number of ways to distribute 7 cookies to 4 kids,
                  all we need to do is count how many
                  <em>stars and bars</em>
                  charts there are.

                  <idx><h>stars and bars</h><h>chart</h></idx>
                  is just a string of symbols, some stars and some bars.
                  If instead of stars and bars we would use 0's and 1's, it would just be a bit string.
                  <idx><h>bit string</h><h>relation to stars and bars</h></idx>
                  We know how to count those.
                  First, let's make sure we really know what we're doing.

                        What does it mean for no two cats to sit next to each other? It means we must place an owl between the first pair of cats and an owl between the second pair.
                        This leaves four owls to distribute between the 3 cats, or <m>\binom{4+2}{2} = 15</m> ways.

                This week, we look at some advanced counting techniques. We've also built in some catchup/review time, which will be useful for preparing for Exam 1 on Friday, March 5.
                This will be a 50-point exam covering Chapters 0 and 1. Expect a couple of short definitions followed by some straightforward questions covering sets, functions, and counting.

        Suppose now you have 13 pies and 7 children.
        No child can have more than 2 pies.
        How many ways can you distribute the pies?
      </p>
      <solution>
        <ol>
            <li>This is a stars and bars problem; there are <m>\binom{11+3}{3} = 364</m> ways to distribute the pies.</li>
            <li>Suppose Al gets 4 pies. Now he is guaranteed too many. There are 7 pies left to distribute among the four children; there are <m>\binom{7 + 3}{3} = 120</m> ways for Al to get too many pies. Since there are 4 children, there are <m>\binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{10}{3}</m> ways for at least one child to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>Now suppose we give two children too many pies. There are <m>\binom{4}{2}</m> ways to choose the children. We'll give each four pies, leaving 3 to be distributed in <m>\binom{3+3}{3}</m> ways. There are then <m>\binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}</m> ways four two or more children to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>It is not possible for three or more kids to get too many pies; thus the number we calculated in the previous part was the number of ways for exactly two kids to get too many pies.</li>
            <li>There are <m>\binom{14}{3}</m> total ways to distribute the pies without restriction. There are <m>\binom{4}{1}\binom{10}{3}</m> ways that one or more kids get too many pies, but we are double-counting the situations in which two kids get too many pies. So we add back the number of times two kids get too many pies, <m>\binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}</m>:
            <me>
                \binom{14}{3} - \binom{4}{1}\binom{10}{3} + \binom{4}{2}\cdot \binom{6}{3}= 4.
            </me>
            This makes sense. The only way to ensure that no one is getting more than 3 is to give 3 to 3 kids and 2 to one. There are 4 ways to choose the kids who gets 2 pies.

            <p>
                Start by giving <em>one</em> kid 4 cookies. Then distribute the remaining 6 to all 5 kids with no restrictions. There are 5 choices for the kid who gets too many, and then <m>5\cdot\binom{10}{4}</m> ways to distribute the cookies<mdash />but be careful! We have counted the outcomes where two kids get at least four cookies multiple times. Thus, we need PIE. There are <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> ways to select which two kids will get spoiled. Then there are two cookies left to distribute to 5 kids, which can happen in <m>\binom{6}{4}</m> ways.

            <p>
                We are not able to give three kids four or more cookies, as we only have 10 to go around. Thus, the number of ways is:

            There are <m>5!</m> permutations in total. Then there are <m>\binom{5}{1}</m> choices for an element to fix, and <m>4!</m> ways to permute the other elements.
            But this will inevitably fix some of the four elements, so we've overcounted. 
            So let's get rid of the permutations that fix two elements: there are <m>\binom{5}{2}</m> choices for the two fixed elements, and 3! ways to permute the remaining elements. But this overcounts the permutations that fix 3 or more elements.

          We count all permutations, and subtract those which are not derangements.
          There are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations of 4 elements.
          Now for a permutation to <em>not</em> be a derangement,
          at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed.
          There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> choices for which single element we fix.
          Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements.

                Alternatively, a function that is not surjective must exclude one or more elements from the domain.
                There are <m>4^5</m> functions which exclude <m>1</m> (similarly, which exclude 2, 3, 4, or 5), so <m>5\cdot 4^5</m> functions which exclude at least 1 element. But we've overcounted, as usual, so we need to add some back in. There are <m>\binom{5}{2}\cdot 3^5</m> ways to exclude 2 or more elements, <m>\binom{5}{3} 2^5</m> ways to exclude 3 or more elements, and <m>\binom{5}{4}\cdot 1^5 = 5</m> ways to exclude four elements.

                There are <m>4^5</m> functions all together;
                we will subtract the functions which are not surjective.
                We could exclude any one of the four elements of the codomain,
                and doing so will leave us with <m>3^5</m> functions for each excluded element.
                This counts too many so we subtract the functions which exclude two of the four elements of the codomain,
                each pair giving <m>2^5</m> functions.
                But this excludes too many,
                so we add back in the functions which exclude three of the four elements of the codomain,
                each triple giving <m>1^5</m> function.
                There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> groups of functions excluding a single element,
                <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> groups of functions excluding a pair of elements,
                and <m>{4 \choose 3}</m> groups of functions excluding a triple of elements.
                This means that the number of functions which are
                <em>not</em> surjective is:

                We can now say that the number of functions which are surjective is:

                  4^5 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^5 - {4 \choose 2}2^5 + {4 \choose 3}1^5\right]

              <p permid="HZp">
                The number of surjective functions is:

                </me>.
                We took the total number of functions <m>5^5</m> and subtracted all that were not surjective.
                There were <m>{5 \choose 1}</m> ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range,
                and for each there were <m>4^5</m> functions.
                But this double counts,
                so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range:
                there are <m>{5 \choose 2}</m> choices for the two elements to exclude,
                and for each pair, <m>3^5</m> functions.
                This takes out too many functions,
                so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range:
                <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> choices for which three to exclude,
                and then <m>2^5</m> functions for each choice of elements.
                Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the
                <m>{5 \choose 4}</m> choices of 4 elements.
              </p>

                If you happen to calculate this number precisely,
                you will get 120 surjections.
                That happens to also be the value of <m>5!</m>.
                This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function <m>f:X \to Y</m> with
                <m>\card{X} = \card{Y}</m> finite must necessarily be a bijection.
                The number of bijections is always <m>\card{X}!</m> in this case.
                What we have here is a <em>combinatorial proof</em>

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Intro to Sequences</title>
    
     <p permid="MRZ">
      A <term>sequence</term>
          <idx><h>sequence</h></idx>
      is simply an ordered list of numbers.
      For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <ellipsis/>.
      This is different from the set <m>\N</m> because,
      while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers,
      in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in.
      For this reason,
      when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
      <me permid="WlL">
        a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
      </me>.
      To refer to the <em>entire</em> sequence at once,
      we will write <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> or <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m>,
      or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just <m>(a_n)</m>
      (in which case we assume we start the sequence with <m>a_0</m>).
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>notation for</h></idx>
      <notation>
        <usage>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</usage>
        <description>the sequence <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots</m></description>
      </notation>

    </p>

    <p permid="sZi">
      We might replace the <m>a</m> with another letter,
      and sometimes we omit <m>a_0</m>, starting with <m>a_1</m>,
      in which case we would use
      <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> to refer to the sequence as a whole.
      The numbers in the subscripts are called <term>indices</term>
      (the plural of <term>index</term>).
    </p>

    <p permid="Zgr">
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>as function</h></idx>
      While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers,
      it is really a type of function.
      Specifically, the sequence
      <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> is a function with domain <m>\N</m> where <m>a_n</m> is the image of the natural number <m>n</m>.
      Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus.
      We can shift a sequence up or down,
      add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence.
      These are done exactly as you would for functions.
    </p>

    <p permid="FnA">
      That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful,
      we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.
    </p>

    <example permid="Kex">
      <statement>

          We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers <m>(0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots)</m>, when we start with <m>n=0</m>, and the powers of 2: <m>(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots)</m>.

                Note that if subtract 1 from each term,
                we get the sequence <m>(T_n)</m>.
                So we have <m>b_n = T_n + 1</m>.
                Therefore a closed formula is <m>b_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1</m>.
                A quick check of the first few <m>n</m> confirms we have it right.

                Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is <m>c_n = a_n+1 = 2^n + 1</m>.
                If we try this though, we get
                <m>c_0 = 2^0 + 1 = 2</m> and <m>c_1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3</m>.
                We are off because the indices are shifted.
                What we really want is <m>c_n = a_{n+1}+1</m> giving <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.

                Notice that all these terms are even.
                What happens if we factor out a 2?
                We get <m>(T_n)</m>!
                More precisely, we find that <m>d_n/2 = T_n</m>,

                These are all triangular numbers.
                However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term.
                So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <m>T_n</m>,
                we would be set.
                Therefore the closed formula is
                <m>e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}</m> (where <m>n+3</m> came from <m>(n+2)+1</m>).
                Thinking about sequences as functions,
                we are doing a horizontal shift by 2:
                <m>e_n = T_{n+2}</m> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.

                Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2.
                You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term
                (the powers of 2 are <em>exactly</em>
                twice the previous term).
                Closed formula: <m>f_n = 2^{n} - 1</m>.

                These numbers are also doubling each time,
                but are also all multiples of 3.
                Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis/>.
                Aha.
                We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

                To get from one term to the next,
                we almost double each term.
                So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>.
                Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.
                So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m>
                (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>,
                not <m>2^0</m>).
                Alternatively,
                we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example:
                starting with 3, 5, 9, 17,
                <ellipsis/> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence.
                That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.
                Our sequence here would be twice this,
                so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as we got before.
              </p>

                <m>(15, 33, 57, 87, 123, \ldots)</m>.
                Try dividing each term by 3.
                That gives the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots</m>.
                Now add 1 to each term: <m>6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots</m>,
                which is <m>(d_n)</m> in this example,
                except starting with 6 instead of 0.
                So let's start with the formula <m>d_n= n(n+1)</m>.
                To start with the 6, we shift: <m>(n+2)(n+3)</m>.
                But this is one too many, so subtract 1:
                <m>(n+2)(n+3) - 1</m>.
                That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3.
                So we want <m>j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)</m>.

        Some sequences, like the triangular numbers, are neither arithmetic nor geometric.
        However, the <em>differences</em> in the terms form an arithmetic sequence, so we can think of <m>T_n</m> as the <term>sequence of partial sums</term> of the sequence <m>1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We can find the sum of an arithmetic sequence using the <term>reverse and add</term> strategy.

            To find <m>2S</m> then we add 472 to itself a number of times.
            What number?
            We need to decide how many terms (<term>summands</term>) are in the sum.
            Since the terms form an arithmetic sequence,
            the <m>n</m>th term in the sum
            (counting <m>2</m> as the 0th term)
            can be expressed as <m>2 + 3n</m>.
            If <m>2 + 3n = 470</m> then <m>n = 156</m>.
            So <m>n</m> ranges from 0 to 156, giving 157 terms in the sum.

                Given a <m>\Delta^k</m>-constant sequence, can we find a (preferably unique) polynomial that <q>fits</q> the sequence?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </question>
    
    <p>
        The answer is really delightful: we can, so long as we have enough data points!

    <theorem>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The closed formula for a sequence will be a degree <m>k</m> polynomial if and only if the sequence is <m>\Delta^k</m>-constant.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
        This should remind us of something that you perhaps observed in calculus: the derivative of a degree <m>n</m> polynomial is constant.
    </p>


    <example permid="qHs">
      <statement>
        <p permid="jMN">
          Find a formula for the sequence <m>3, 7, 14, 24,\ldots</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution permid="byu">
        <p permid="mHt">
          First, check to see if the formula has constant differences at some level.
          The sequence of first differences is <m>4, 7, 10, \ldots</m> which is arithmetic,
          so the sequence of second differences is constant.
          The sequence is <m>\Delta^2</m>-constant,
          so the formula for <m>a_n</m> will be a degree 2 polynomial.
          That is, we know that for some constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>,
          and <m>c</m>,
          <me permid="qlT">

        <p permid="SOC">
          Now to find <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.
          First, it would be nice to know what <m>a_0</m> is,
          since plugging in <m>n = 0</m> simplifies the above formula greatly.
          In this case, <m>a_0 = 2</m>
          (work backwards from the sequence of constant differences).
          Thus
          <me permid="Wtc">
            a_0 = 2 = a\cdot 0^2 + b \cdot 0 + c
          </me>,
          so <m>c = 2</m>.
          Now plug in <m>n =1</m> and <m>n = 2</m>.
          We get

        <p permid="yVL">
          At this point we have two (linear) equations and two unknowns,
          so we can solve the system for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
          (using substitution or elimination or even matrices).
          We find <m>a = \frac{3}{2}</m> and <m>b = \frac{-1}{2}</m>,

          First, it is easy to check the initial condition:

    <title>Special Cases: Iteration and Telescoping</title>
    
    <p>
        Sometimes we can find the closed form by inspection.
    </p>
    
    <example permid="Yip">
      <statement>
        <p permid="CeM">
          Solve the recurrence relation
          <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + n</m> with initial term <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="pgA">
        <p permid="Pyx">
          To get a feel for the recurrence relation,
          write out the first few terms of the sequence:
          <m>4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, \ldots</m>.
          Look at the difference between terms.
          <m>a_1 - a_0 = 1</m> and <m>a_2 - a_1 = 2</m> and so on.
          The key thing here is that the difference between terms is <m>n</m>.
          We can write this explicitly:
          <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = n</m>.
          Of course, we could have arrived at this conclusion directly from the recurrence relation by subtracting <m>a_{n-1}</m> from both sides.
        </p>

        <p permid="vFG">
          Now use this equation over and over again,
          changing <m>n</m> each time:
          <md permid="BJn">
            <mrow>a_1 - a_0 \amp = 1</mrow>

            <mrow>\vdots \quad \amp \quad \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>a_n - a_{n-1} \amp = n</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="bMP">
          Add all these equations together.
          On the right-hand side, we get the sum <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.
          We already know this can be simplified to <m>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.
          What happens on the left-hand side?
          We get
          <me permid="qAo">
            (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})+ (a_n - a_{n-1})
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="HTY">
          This sum telescopes.
          We are left with only the <m>-a_0</m> from the first equation and the <m>a_n</m> from the last equation.
          Putting this all together we have
          <m>-a_0 + a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m> or <m>a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + a_0</m>.
          But we know that <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
          So the solution to the recurrence relation,
          subject to the initial condition is
          <me permid="WHx">
            a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 4
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="obh">
          (Now that we know that,
          we should notice that the sequence is the result of adding 4 to each of the triangular numbers.)

        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    
    <p>
        This example works in part because there are the same number of <m>a_n</m>'s as <m>a_{n-1}</m>'s.
        A technique known as <term>iteration</term> can be used if that isn't the case; see <url href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_recurrence.html#kwH">Example 2.4.5</url> of the text for more.

          The characteristic polynomial is <m>x^2 - 6x + 9</m>.
          We solve the characteristic equation
          <me permid="wZu">
            x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0
          </me>
          by factoring:
          <me permid="dgD">
            (x - 3)^2 = 0
          </me>
          so <m>x =3</m> is the only characteristic root.
          Therefore we know that the solution to the recurrence relation has the form
          <me permid="JnM">
            a_n = a 3^n + bn3^n
          </me>
          for some constants <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          Now use the initial conditions:
          <md permid="alX">
            <mrow>a_0 = 1 \amp = a 3^0 + b\cdot 0 \cdot 3^0 = a</mrow>
            <mrow>a_1 = 4 \amp = a\cdot 3 + b\cdot 1 \cdot3 = 3a + 3b</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since <m>a = 1</m>, we find that <m>b = \frac{1}{3}</m>.
          Therefore the solution to the recurrence relation is
          <me permid="puV">
            a_n = 3^n + \frac{1}{3}n3^n

        <p>
            Throughout the course, we'll collect lots of ways to count things. However, they often seem really similar to one another, so in this appendix I will try to collect various archetypal problems and methodologies.
            This will be a work in progress.
