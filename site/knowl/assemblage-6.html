<p><ul class="disc">
<li><p>The proof begins by restating our assumtion: that we are working with a general even integer, <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Note that we are <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">not</em> considering a specific even integer, such as 18, and verifying that its square is even. Part of the power of mathematics is that we have tools for proving <em xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="emphasis">general</em> statements about all even integers at once. Proofs are not examples, and you shouldn't treat them as such.</p></li>
<li><p>The proof is written using complete sentences!</p></li>
<li><p>The proof takes the reader on a journey, using plural pronouns and active language: “we may rewrite...,” etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The proof avoids the use of pronouns to refer to a mathematical objects; we don't square “it”, we square <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> This keeps things clear and easy to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Each step follows from the one before it, though specific reasons are not always cited. Determining when it's appropriate to cite, say, a definition or theorem by number is a bit of an art form. We'll figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p>The proof ends by clearly stating the conclusion we sought.</p></li>
<li><p>You should consider your audience. If your audience is a group of research mathematicians, you'll write a far different proof than if you are writing for your classmates. You should write for your classmates.</p></li>
