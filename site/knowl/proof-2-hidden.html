<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Suppose ten ducks are paddling in four ponds, but no pond contains at least three paddling ducks. This means that each of the four ponds contains at most two ducks. <aside class="aside aside-like"><p>Why?</p></aside> That is, the first pond contains at most two ducks, the second pond contains at most two ducks, the third pond contains at most two ducks, and the fourth pond contains at most two ducks, for a total of (at most!) <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(2+2+2+2 = 8\)</span> ducks. This contradicts the given assumption that ten ducks are paddling in four ponds. Thus, there must be a pond with at least three ducks.</p></article></body>
