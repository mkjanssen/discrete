<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To determine how many elements are in at least one of \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) or \(C\) we add up all the elements in each of those sets. However, when we do that, any element in both \(A\) and \(B\) is counted twice. Also, each element in both \(A\) and \(C\) is counted twice, as are elements in \(B\) and \(C\text{,}\) so we take each of those out of our sum once. But now what about the elements which are in \(A \cap B \cap C\) (in all three sets)? We added them in three times, but also removed them three times. They have not yet been counted. Thus we add those elements back in at the end.</p>
