<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Suppose for a contradiction that all edges incident with \(a\) are cut edges. Let \(b\) be the other vertex of odd degree in \(G\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Since \(G\) is connected, there is a path \(P\) from \(a\) to \(b\text{.}\) Exactly one edge incident to \(a\) is traversed by \(P\text{.}\) Let \(e\) be any other edge incident at \(a\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now consider the graph \(G' = G\setminus e\text{.}\) This graph has exactly two components. Since the path \(P\) does not use \(e\text{,}\) vertices \(a\) and \(b\) are in the same component. Notice also that, in \(G'\text{,}\) vertex \(a\) has even degree, and all other vertices in its component have not changed degree. This means that, in  \(G'\text{,}\) there is exactly one vertex of odd degree, which is a contradiction.</p></article></body>
