<h1 class="title">Math 212 Portfolio</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="assignment-description">Assignment Description</h2>
<p>Your portfolio is the major summative work of this class. It will be a demonstration of your growth in this class and mastery of the material. The final portfolio will consist of 9 polished problems and their solutions/proofs. Together, we will work from your first draft to a “perfect” proof.</p>
<h3 id="current-version">Current Version</h3>
<p>An up-to-date clean version of the portfolio is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds/portfolio/m212-portfolio.tex&amp;splash=none">available in Overleaf</a> or via <a href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds/portfolio/m212-portfolio.tex">direct download</a>.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>There are several goals for this assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved written communication</em>. Perhaps one of the most important goals of the proof portfolio is to work on your ability to write well. I don’t know anyone who was born a good mathematical writer. Writing mathematics is decidedly different than writing an essay (just as, you may have noticed, reading a math text is different than reading a novel) and it will take some time to get good at it. The proof portfolio gives you many opportunities to learn from mistakes.</li>
<li><em>Learning LaTeX.</em> Mathematical typesetting in LaTeX is an important goal in this course. In future courses you’ll be able to do your homework faster and better, and it will look more professional. You’ll be glad you learned it, trust me!</li>
<li><em>Time to think individually and to get individual feedback</em>. Since collaboration on some of the other assignments is allowed and encouraged, this is an opportunity to rely on yourself and see how much you know as an individual. In addition, it’s an opportunity for me to get to know you as a mathematician and a writer.</li>
<li><em>The opportunity to act on feedback</em>. You will get lots of feedback on assignments in this course, but there is often no chance to revise and resubmit. This is a chance for you and me to make sure you understand my feedback and correct mistakes.</li>
<li><em>Seeing a proof through to perfection.</em> I hope this will be intensely satisfying.</li>
<li><em>Celebrating your progress.</em> It’s important to do this else the constant presentation of new challenges would have us all feeling like failures all the time.</li>
<li><em>Build a resource for later.</em> You will have 9 typed solutions/proofs and at least one example of every proof technique we’ll learn in the course. This could be of use in the event that you ever forget, say, how induction works.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
<p>Each statement will be written in the form of a conjecture (a mathematical claim) among which you will have some choice. Each conjecture asks you to prove or disprove the conjecture, possibly along with some additional directions. If the proposition is true, your job is to write a complete proof for the proposition. If it is false, you should provide a counterexample plus make reasonable modifications to the stated conjecture so that a new proposition is true. Then, write a complete proof of your new proposition. You may want to run your new proposition by me before trying to write a proof - this is allowed and encouraged!</p>
<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>The portfolio is an independent project in which no outside resources or collaboration is allowed. You may not ask other professors or discuss the problems with anyone besides me. You should not discuss even which problem you chose. Violation of this policy is grounds for failing the course. The point is that you need to be confident and competent in writing proofs for your future courses.</p>
<p><strong>Throughout this process remember that I am here to support you!</strong></p>
<h2 id="submission-of-drafts">Submission of Drafts</h2>
<p>Portfolio problems are due according to the schedule described <a href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds">here</a>. <strong>Assuming your work was submitted on time</strong>, I’ll leave electronic feedback based on the <a href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds/ProofRubric.pdf">rubric</a> on your submitted PDF. You will then be able to incorporate my feedback into a new draft. <strong>I strongly encourage you to discuss your changes with me before resubmitting your new draft, especially if you have any lingering questions about the problem, my comments, etc.</strong></p>
<p>In general, I will give feedback once every two weeks or so, OR after the submission of new problems, whichever is shorter. So, in a sense, each deadline listed is a deadline for the new problems, as well as new drafts of all previous problems.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<p>As stated before you are not allowed to use outside resources or collaborate with your classmates. <strong>You should, however, use me for help</strong>.</p>
<p>To aid in this I ask that you work on this semester-long project early and often. Before you visit <a href="https://calendly.com/mkjanssen/student-hours">student hours</a> I expect that you have tried the problem (you should at least know the definitions of terms in the problem and have made an attempt at one type of solution/proof). You can ask me a question at any time (before submitting the first draft of a proof or after you’ve submitted a draft). I only ask that you be respectful of my time. <strong>I will at no point walk you through a proof, but I will provide hints!</strong></p>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>The problems are intending to be challenging. They will emphasize critical analysis and writing skills. Portfolio problems are evaluated on the basis of completeness, correctness, and adherence to our writing guidelines. All drafts will be graded on an EMRN scale according to my <a href="https://prof.mkjanssen.org/ds/ProofRubric.pdf">standard proof rubric</a>, summarized below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>E</strong>xceeds expectations: The work is complete, precisely written, demonstrates correct reasoning and full support for all claims and computations, is free from mathematical and communication errors, and indicates a high level of understanding of the mathematical concepts involved. The work meets all writing guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong>eets expectations: The work is complete, demonstrates correct reasoning and support for its claims and computations. There may be a few isolated errors in mathematics, writing, reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>evision needed: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant issues with completeness, correctness, precision of language or notation, or logic that can be improved with revision.</li>
<li><strong>N</strong>ot assessable: The work has significant gaps, omissions, or errors; or, there are widespread significant issues completeness, correctness, precision of language or notation, or logic that require more than just a simple revision.</li>
</ul>
